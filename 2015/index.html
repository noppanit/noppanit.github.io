      <p>I just want to take a break from writing about technical posts to just talk about myself a little bit. I’m inspired by Scott Muc’s <a href="http://scottmuc.com/my-resolutions-for-2015/" title="Scott's 2015 Resolution">post</a> about his 2015 Resolutions. Before getting into 2015 I want to take a step back and review my 2014</p>

<h2 id="my-2014">My 2014</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I got the opportunity to work in Turkey as part of my consulting job with <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" title="ThougthWorks">ThoughtWorks</a>. I can count Turkey to be my 6th country I have lived and worked in. I used to work and live in Thailand, China, India, United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey.</li>
  <li>Learned C#. C# is the first language I learnt at school when Windows Form was a big thing. I loved it but then the web took over and I felt in love with Java instead and never look back. The project in Turkey is C# so I got to relearn that again and I can say that I like it more than Java now. The language is nicer and more functional. I can do more stuff with less code.</li>
  <li>Moved to the US.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="my-2015">My 2015</h2>

<h3 id="move-to-the-us-and-join-fusion">Move to the US and join Fusion</h3>

<p>I decided to join <a href="http://fusion.net">Fusion</a> and left my glamorous consulting job. Partly because of the city. I felt in love with New York City when I was there in 2013 for a conference and I thought it would be nice to live here. When the opportunity came I took it immediately. Now two months passed by and I still love the city and my job. Much to explore and lots of places to travel in the US. Fusion is also the first place I get to know what’s like to work remotely. I absolutely love it. I get to be anywhere and also do what I love which is coding. I will write another post about remote collaboration later. Fusion is a media company which is a new field that I haven’t explored before.</p>

<h3 id="join-kollaboration">Join Kollaboration</h3>

<p>I join <a href="http://www.kollaborationnewyork.org" title="Kollaboration New York">Kollaboration</a> New York as a Technical Director because of my roommate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tannerchung" title="Tanner Chung">Tanner Chung</a>. Kollaboration is a non-profit organization that help and promote Asian American artists through entertainment. In this organization, I get to learn what’s like to be Asian American. I’m asian myself but I was born in Asia. So, I didn’t know the problems a lot of asian people living abroad having.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-want-to-do-in-2015">What I want to do in 2015</h2>

<h3 id="learn-to-invest">Learn to invest</h3>

<p>Who doesn’t want to have money? I’m going to learn how to invest my saving and will keep posting the results.</p>

<h3 id="travel-across-america">Travel across America</h3>

<p>When I was living in Europe, you can get to a lot of countries in just 2-3 hours but in America everywhere is so big and South American has always been my dream location.</p>

<h3 id="learn-spanish">Learn Spanish</h3>

<p>My previous goal leads to this goal. I speak Thai, English and Mandarin. I learnt German before but didn’t really get anywhere. This year I’m going to learn Spanish and make it my fourth language. I love languages and it’s fun to talk to the locals and amazed them with their language.</p>

<h3 id="run-a-marathon">Run a marathon</h3>

<p>My friend Rajveer and <a href="https://twitter.com/sragu">Srini</a> inspire me to running. I’m a chubby guy and I really want to get into shape. Running a marathon takes a lot out of you mentally and physically. I thought if I could do it at least for once, I’d accomplish something.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I started off 2015 pretty good. I went to India for my friend’s wedding in Rajasthan. I went to US west coast to experience super cold whether. I learned PHP and WordPress and improved my JavaScript skills which I will continue doing that.</p>
