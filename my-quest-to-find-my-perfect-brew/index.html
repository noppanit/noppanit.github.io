<p>. You can order this lousy T-Shirt <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/programmer_definition_t_shirt-235878094715752076">here</a>.</p>

<p>I know everybody loves a cup of Joe. I&#8217;m amazed when people order decaf coffee which I have to resist myself to ask this question every time, &#8220;Why on earth you want to drink that?&#8221;, I&#8217;m sure most people who are coffee fanatic will ask the same question. Well, that&#8217;s the purpose of this blog here. I love coffee and I love it dark, rich and no milk. Now my love for coffee grows and I cannoy quench my thirst for a perfect cup with my french press anymore, so I seek help from professionals.</p>

<p>So far, I have been drinking my coffee from <a href="http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/" title="monmouth coffee">Monmouth</a> in London, which I&#8217;m sure people love them and lucky me my office is just 5 min walk to the coffee shop. But what about at home? How do I drink the same quality coffee at home. Like most people, when I was a student I could not afford a Â£2 cup of coffee. My coffee intake had always come from instant coffee. Now I have (not so much) money I can enjoy what I love drinking the most. I started with filter coffee which you can buy filters from supermarket. They&#8217;re cheap and you can make a decent coffee if done it right. However, I don&#8217;t want to buy new filters every week considering how much I drink coffee everyday. Until my girlfriend gave me this as my birthday present with ground coffee from Starbucks (I know, I know but hey that was my first ground coffee). My life has changed you just pour ground coffee and in with hot water wait for a couple minutes and plunge and enjoy!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my setting so far.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/French-Press-5.jpg"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/French-Press-5.jpg" alt="French Press" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1142 cool_border" /></a></p>

<p>My quest has not stopped there. I decided to take a further step by taking up a Barista course at <a href="http://www.taylor-st.com/home-barista-course" title="TAylor">taylor</a>. I have learned more about coffee origins, cupping, how to stream milk and good ratio for espresso.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my take from the course which I think it was really comprehensive.</p>

<ul>
<li>Never buy ground coffee, once the coffee has been grinned it&#8217;s losing its aroma and quality.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t stock up your coffee, buy small batch and don&#8217;t keep it longer than 6 months.</li>
<li>Good ratio for espresso and water is 1:1.2, but you need to find your golden ratio. And it&#8217;s different for every coffee. So, if you try new coffee you need to adjust your balance.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t freeze your coffee, think of it as your spice.</li>
<li>Grind size, does and time matter a lot to your coffee</li>
</ul>


<p>After I have learned all of this I changed my way of making coffee. I still cannot afford a decent espresso machine but I know how to tune up my way of making coffee. I used to just put some 2-3 table spoons of coffee and boiling water and then plunge it right away. Sometime I over-extracted the coffee by letting the coffee submerged too long. Here&#8217;s some of the steps I have changed.</p>

<p>I still haven&#8217;t got a decent grinder so I&#8217;m still relying on my ground coffee from supermarket. I&#8217;ll buy a grinder soon which I&#8217;ll blog about that later.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of putting 2-3 table spoons of coffee, I weight it around 16-20 grams.</li>
<li>Instead of using boiling water, I put the kettle on, let it boil and after the switch is cut I leave it there for ~2 minutes so the temp drops to around 90. I remember went I bought a cup of coffee from big chained coffee shop and I had to let the coffee sit there for 10 minutes before I could even sip it.</li>
<li>Instead of guessing the amount of water, I use around 240mm for a cup of coffee. (This is not for espresso though).</li>
<li>Stir the coffee twice to make sure that all the coffee is submerged.</li>
<li>Instead of extract the coffee for sometime, I time it for 3:30 minutes and the last 30 seconds I just plunge and pour the coffee right away.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was really surprised how much my cup of Joe has changed even though I didn&#8217;t change the coffee or even my french press.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m not going to stop just there, my quest continues. Now, I&#8217;m looking for a decent Espresso machine for my home brew&#8230;</p>
