Yesterday, I had a chance to study Oracle Web Portal with my latest company, they ask me to research portal before I will be being trained this Saturday.

So, first thing first I have to know what is web portal, I cannot give this definition better than wikipedia, thus I hand out this task to them. <a title="Web Portal" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_portal" target="_blank">The Definition</a>. I will give just a brief definition. It&#8217;s just like a dynamic web, which you can add <a title="Portlets" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portlet" target="_blank">Portlets</a> to the web and create report and form within a click. It&#8217;s easy to mange and administer, because oracle has lots of tools to do those tasks. Or regions, items, tabs and portlets can be added to the web without write a single code. You can maintain web portal graphically. Users and Groups can also be maintained, hence the administrator can grant accessibility to users and groups so they can access to which pages and which portlets they can use. Users and groups are come from LADP (Oracle Internet Directory).

The best example I can give you is <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank">http://www.yahoo.com</a>. It&#8217;s has lots of portlets in their web, such as weather, stock prices, etc&#8230; . Or if I want to say, web portal is a CMS (Content Management System) that can add a small application that can do certain function to a web. Moreover, developers can also develop their own portlets and deploy on a web application server and register portlets to web portal.
