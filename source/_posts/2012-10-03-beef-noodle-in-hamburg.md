Well, I know I have been posting about something else other than geeky stuff. But it&#8217;s good to do something else and as my twitter bio said. I&#8217;m foodie. So, one day I was working in Hamburg and got bored and craved for Chinese food. After a little asking on my old friend &#8220;Google&#8221; I ran into this post. [http://mealbymel.blogspot.de/2011/09/meister-lo-nudelhaus.html][1] and I went. My first impression would be that the restaurant is compact, you can see an open kitchen. As I said I craved for Chinese food, so I didn&#8217;t even look at the menu and ordered &#8220;Beef noodle&#8221;. This is what I get, my picture is not that good but the taste says different.

I&#8217;m a little disappointed by the noodle as the blog above said but the meat which is the heart of this dish is delicious. It&#8217;s chunky and meaty, and the soup is clear and not too strong. The location is not quite good as it&#8217;s quite a walk from the station and to get there by Bahn. And I guess that&#8217;s why they can keep the cost down as for the appetiser, noodle and a melon cost me just 8 euros. If you&#8217;re in Hamburg and want to have taste some authentic Taiwanese, you should try it out. And I&#8217;d go back there if I have a chance.
