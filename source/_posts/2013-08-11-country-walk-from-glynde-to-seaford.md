OK! I get bored and don&#8217;t have anything to do. I was sitting in front of my computer and search what can I do near London. And I found this [][1]shtml</li> 

. I have to admit apart from boring and sucky weather in the UK, there&#8217;s one thing I really love, UK Countryside. The view, scenery, fellow walkers and farm animals. So, I picked this walk and I just went for it the next day. 

the book really gives a precise instructions to follow. If you follow every detail in the book, you won&#8217;t get lost. Also, the book gives you local pubs and restaurants to visit. 

This is where I started.

Local market. It&#8217;s really a family run and you will get a warm smile when you walk in the store.

Lonely barley.

This for me is the toughest part of the walk, it&#8217;s right before you climb up Seven Sisters. It&#8217;s quite steep and long.

I&#8217;m going to try this someday.

A soup at George Inn.

This fellow is really funny. She was chasing me all the way to the end of the field. I don&#8217;t know why, but I think it&#8217;s because I had food in my rucksack. Later, when I met my fellow walkers they told me they had the same problem as well.

Really good view.

Seven Sisters on the other side. The view was taken from Seaford side, where most people are on the other Eastbourne side.
