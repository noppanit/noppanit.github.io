This might just be me and this blog post is just my opinion and just give people another opinion if they&#8217;re interested in buying a travel tripod. I&#8217;m sure you will own either one or two tripods if you&#8217;re a serious photographer. Even if you&#8217;re not there&#8217;s a chance that you will own at least one. I have one as well, but very clunky and heavy which I got it really cheap because of the heavy material. And I thought I didn&#8217;t mind to carry it around I can just put it in a car. However, I rarely take it with me when I&#8217;m on a trip. Why? because as you travel a lot, you tend to travel light and those tripods won&#8217;t fit in your suitcase. Also, you don&#8217;t want to carry huge tripod around the airport, I learnt that the hard way when I was in India. I needed to get my tripod scanned and wrapped and scanned again. They had to make sure I could not dissemble my tripod to be a weapon or some sort. It was fun though.

Now I have found this, [Manfrotto Befree][1]. Why I think it&#8217;s perfect for me. Because I can fit that in my suitcase so I won&#8217;t have any problem carrying it with me on a trip and it&#8217;s really small so I will have less trouble carrying it with me when I&#8217;m hiking. However, it&#8217;s not carbon fibre so it won&#8217;t be super light, but because of its size it&#8217;s not too heavy. I can carry it with my 5D all day. 

That&#8217;s the best bit for a travel tripod. However, you won&#8217;t use that for a 9-hour long exposure for sure as it&#8217;s not that sturdy but for taking night views with not-so-long exposure or even fireworks it works really well. So, it&#8217;s just another opinion if you&#8217;re thinking of buying a travel tripod.
