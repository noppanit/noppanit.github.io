I usually don&#8217;t blog about my trip, but this one it&#8217;s a bit different because I only had one day and I think [Liechtenstein][1] is a really nice country and really worth a visit, if you like trekking like me. 

Liechtenstein is right now the sixth smallest country in the world, which shares borders with, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. It&#8217;s so small that it doesn&#8217;t have an airport. The easiest to get into that I found out is through Switzerland. You can get a flight to Zurich and from there, buy a ticket to Buchs SG and from Buchs you can get a Bus from there to Liechtenstein which is just 20 minutes from Buchs.

Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t know where to go in Liechtenstein, just get in there and you&#8217;ll find out. The country is so small where you can go anywhere within 30 minutes. When you&#8217;re inside Liechtenstein you need one of these for your plan. You can get one on the bus.

If you don&#8217;t know where to go I recommend Malbun. You can look it on of your timetable and find a stop &#8220;Malbun&#8221;
