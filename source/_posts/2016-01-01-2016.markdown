## Goals for 2016

I want to make this a habit for me that I want to make goals for every year and commit to them. So, here's what I want to achieve in 2016. 

### Fitness, psychically and mentally. 

I know everyone makes this a New Year resolution. But I really want to make this true this year. I'm not much overweight and I lift. I'm really into 5x5 program and I've just busted my plateau from last year. This year, I want to be more consistent. Another important thing is I'm going to run a marathon this year as I didn't do it last year even if it's just going to be me. 

Progress
1. Squat 185lb
2. Oh Press 80lb
3. Deadlift 265lb
4. Barbell Row 170lb

I'd like to increase every move by at least 25lb by the end of this year. 

The most important thing for me this year is my mental hygiene. When I was a monk, I used to meditate 30 minutes a day but once I got out of it I never did it. I'm going to make this my mission to meditate 10-15 minutes a day before going to bed. I added this as my daily habit on my habitica.

This resolution kinda sums everything that I want 2016 to be. I just want to be a happy me. If something's going to create more stress I'm just going to say no. 

### Reach level of my fluency in Spanish

I've just started learning Spanish a couple months ago and I like the language. There's levels of fluency but I want to be able to make at least basic conversation. I should be comfortable ordering meals in Spanish restaurants in New York city. I'm planning to travel in South America and I would like to be able to make conversation with local people. I don't want to be able to read news or make business conversation.

### Become a Data Scientist

It wouldn't be complete without a technical goal. I've just changed my career as my interests in data grew. Now I'm a Data Engineer. My day to day job is to create and maintain data pipeline for an organization. I still build stuff but it's just different product. I like my job now but I would like to get involved more in the science. I'm taking Statistics courses and learning some algorithms to analyse a large dataset. I don't have a degree in maths so it's going to be a challenge for me but hey challenge accepted. 

### Travel

I know this is everyone's resolution. I have been to a lot of countries when I was working with ThoughtWorks. I'd like to go to less countries but spend more time to learn the culture and talking to local people. I used to just go to different countries to hangout by the bar or restaurant but this year I'm going to make less trips but more meaningful.
