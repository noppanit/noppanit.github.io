  <a href="http://www.mygenerationsoftware.com/">MyGeneration</a> is a tool that we can use to generate code and mapping file, that we do not to write it by yourself.

  1. Download and Install program<br /> 2. Configure Database, Which I choose SQLServer 2005 Express Edition
</p>

> ** Connection String** : Provider=SQLOLEDB.1;Integrated Security=SSPI;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=sa;Initial Catalog=<Database>;Data Source=<Server>

  3. Choose online template library<br /> 4. Choose NHibernate template and download it<br /> 5. Click Play Button and change some options on your own.<br /> 6. After MyGeneration generated code, we must change a little things before we can use,such as xml and some privacy of variable, anyway, it depend on what template you choose.
