Because I&#8217;m using Oracle Application Server 10.1.3 and I could not find create oc4j instance, So I have to use command-line to create one.

<div class="codetop">
  CODE
</div>

<div class="codemain">
  $ createinstance -instancename yourinstancename
</div>

and then enter the password.  
That&#8217;s it
