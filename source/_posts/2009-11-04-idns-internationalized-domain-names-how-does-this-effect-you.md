IDNs, Internationalized Domain Names. How does this thing effect you?

[ICANN][1] who is responsible for assigning domain name for World Wide Web has approved the first Non-Latin Characters Domain Name. So, What is this. If you don&#8217;t understand what DNS is, please visit this site.?? [DNS][2]. Basically, DNS is just like the address on the Internet. On the Internet you have a particular IP address, eg: 65.54.56.54?? that leads to your homepage or website, and translate those IP address to human understandable language. Like, http://www.google.co or http://www.hotmail.com .

But what happened a few week ago, I just woke up and turned the TV and suddenly came up to me was ICANN had already approved IDNs for everyone to access and for non-english speakers. So, from now on, you could have your website spelled out your name in your language like http://นพนิตย์.คอม I think nowadays, we are moving to globalisation. Everyone is connected via the Internet. We are changing.

Somebody might think I don&#8217;t want this, I understand English. But what about 60-year-old Chineses who don&#8217;t understand an English word. It must be very tough for them to read English. Even my mother, she understands a little English, but she couldn&#8217;t find a website which is written in English.

I think this is a biggest change that happened since the Internet was invented 4 decades ago. However, that lead to many more questions. What about English speakers who don&#8217;t even and try to understand Chinese, Korea, Hindu or Thai language. How are they gonna do if they what to visit my website, http://我的. And they don&#8217;t have Thai characters on their keyboard? But every computers and laptops have English characters. Is that gonna stop us to communicate with our friends across the world. What if?? a European company wants to communicate with a company in China. How are they gonna do, if they don&#8217;t understand how are they gonna type Chinese characters to access the website? Hmm. It might be fun for us to force to introduce a new standard language for us, which every can speak the same language without barrier.
