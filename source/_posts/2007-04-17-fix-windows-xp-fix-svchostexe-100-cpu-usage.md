Does anybody encounters problems, svchost.exe consume most of CPU. I don&#8217;t know does anybody has the same problem with me?, but my problem is about Windows Update. CPU utilization would hit 100% when windows xp want to updating something, it take so much time. This is how I fix about it.

You can just turn it off but If you turned off you cannot update via website either.

You can use this program to watch what process consume most of your CPU. You can see every processes and every application.
