I have just started using virtuemart extension of Joomla. I was wondering how am I gonna change the front page of Joomla to be virtuemart. In other words, when visiting the homepage I want to see the catalogue first. I&#8217;m too lazy to find a way to the catalogue.

1. Sing into the admin area,  
2. Go to Menu > MainMenu  
3. Unpublish the original &#8220;Home&#8221; menu item.  
4. Click &#8220;New&#8221;  
5. Select &#8220;Component&#8221; and choose &#8220;VirtueMart&#8221;  
6. Be sure to name the new menu item &#8220;Home&#8221;, otherwise it will not work properly.

Note: Because Joomla considers &#8220;Home&#8221; as a homepage
