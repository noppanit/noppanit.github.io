I think everybody knows Twitter, if you haven&#8217;t used it. I&#8217;m pretty sure that you might have heard of it at some point. So, briefly it&#8217;s a service where you can post anything in 140 characters. Most people tweet about news and what&#8217;s going on in their life. But some people is monitoring some hashtag or keywords and spam you back as well.

However, recently I&#8217;ve been tweeting and complaining or even asking questions a lot on Twitter and am surprise the response I got back every time. I know this is not something new.

For example, I didn&#8217;t know where to find a dentist, so I tweeted &#8220;Where can I find a dentist around Holborn?&#8221; And this is the response I got. 

> @noppanit We have studios Covent Garden, Soho, Bank Moorgate and Canary Wharf if any of these suit? 

And I went there and I was happy to go there. So, if you&#8217;re a small business and don&#8217;t know where to start marketing, twitter marketing by monitoring keywords and hashtags might work for you.
