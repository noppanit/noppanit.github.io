I know this is a stupid but as I&#8217;m a Photoshop beginner. As I&#8217;m working on someone else document. There are loads of layers in a document and I&#8217;m see a document in front of me, but I don&#8217;t know which layer should I be looking at. 

There is a way in Mac.  
Just go on the document use Option+Command+Right Click and boom!
