If you&#8217;re like me, having an bold 9700 with OS6 and it&#8217;s getting slower. Don&#8217;t know what to do and want to buy a new phone but your pocket is not that deep. The truth is Bold 9700 isn&#8217;t designed for OS6, but who wants OS5 or even OS5. So after installing OS6 to your bold 9700 you will have probably around 68 MB left in your mobile memory. And after installing a couple of applications, such as Gmail, Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp. You might have some left and once you use it for a day or two, your beloved phone starts to slow down as though you might want to throw it away and get an iPhone4. 

There&#8217;s a way to increase some memory. It&#8217;s an application called [Shrink-A-OS][1]. The steps are very easy, choose your latest official firmware and install it to your computer. Then install BBHTool, run the program. BBHTool will detect the OS that you installed in your computer. Start ticking application that you don&#8217;t want, fonts, or languages that you can&#8217;t even read. Then click &#8220;Shrink My OS&#8221; button. It will show you how much memory you&#8217;ve saved. I saved almost 50-60 MB from the shrinking. I know there&#8217;s a button to Launch Loader, but it doesn&#8217;t work for me. So, you could just go to &#8220;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Research In Motion\AppLoader&#8221; and run Loader.exe then follow the steps and BAM! you got a faster, more memory bold 9700. Hope you enjoy!
