I have been struggling about finding a way to rotate my pictures which are taken vertically. It&#8217;s very time consuming if I have taken 100 images vertically and I have to rotate every single picture in my computer. So, here are the result that I found.

1. You can use the program that comes with you camera. I use Canon?? 400D, so I use ZoomBrowser to get the pictures from my camera.  
2. But, I have another choice which is &#8220;Acdsee&#8221;, the most incredible program about managing you photos. You can use Acdsee to get your images from the your camera. You the function that comes with the program. While you are getting the images from Acdsee, the program will check your image whether or not your image was shot vertically and the program will rotate it automatically.

Note : Do not just copy your pictures from memory card directly, because it will stay the same.
