I have found this problem from my sister notebook. She had a problem which the registry was unintentionally cleaned. She run a registry program, and it did clean the registry, but it did more than that. So, my sister computer cannot find the shortcut file type which made all of shortcuts dead, and the shortcut file type was gone. For instance, when she clicked the programs on Start Menu; that programs are made from lnk file type. Those programs didn&#8217;t respond, because the computer cannot find shortcut file type. The problem can be solved by fixing shortcut file type.
