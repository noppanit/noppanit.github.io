This is just another application that choose to implement in nodejs, because it&#8217;s easy and very useful to use. What do you usually do when you need to learn a new language? You have to remember as many as vocabularies right? Here&#8217;s what I used to do when I was learning Chinese. Have a deck of story cards and wrote down vocabulary on one side and meaning on the other side. 

My application [https://github.com/noppanit/my-flash-card][1] is to demonstrate how easy it is to write an application in NodeJs with a touch of CSS3 to make it elegant. 

My first version is using json as a mean of database, but the next version I&#8217;m going to use RedisToGo because I&#8217;m hosting this application on heroku.
