I was developing a website that can view a pop-up image, but I only implement it myself. Today, I have found something that&#8217;s quite useful. It&#8217;s [lightBox2][1].

&#8220;Lightbox is a *simple, unobtrusive* script used to overlay images on the current page. It&#8217;s a *snap to setup* and works on *all modern browsers*.&#8221;

It&#8217;s authentic!!!!.
