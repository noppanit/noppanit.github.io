  Truly, I looked on this site <a href="http://www.pdamobiz.com/show_news.asp?NewsID=82022&PN=1">http://www.pdamobiz.com/show_news.asp?NewsID=82022&PN=1.</a><br /> So, I try it on my own. I don&#8217;t know much about science, So I cannot explain what happen with the signal and why DVD can help increase signal. I have been watch Discovery Channel about use silver paper increase mobile phone&#8217;s signal. I think it use the same theory.
