I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen or had this before, but it happened to me once. I woke up one they, just wanted to look at my status and how my friends were doing. I open http://www.facebook.com and I realised that I couldn&#8217;t log in to my Facebook account. WTF! Then I did everything I could, go to Facebook Help, Reset Password, googled lots of blogs. Then I gave up, I ended up creating a new Facebook account and found out that lots of people on the Internet had the same problems as I had. I tried emailing Facebook Help Centre as well and got some replies but nothing was helpful. Also, it was like seven months ago. 

What I did was just beek reporting the other account, like Inappropriate profile picture, or this account pretends to be me. And then today, my other Facebook account has been deleted already. I&#8217;m happy!.
