I have a chance to knwo Composite Design Pattern,?? so I don&#8217;t want to forget that immediately.

Composite allows a group of objects to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of composite is to &#8220;compose&#8221; objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly<sup id="cite_ref-GangOfFour_0-0">.<br /> </sup>

Composite can be used when clients should ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects<sup id="cite_ref-GangOfFour_0-1">. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern#cite_note-GangOfFour-0"></a></sup>If programmers find that they are using multiple objects in the same way, and often have nearly identical code to handle each of them, then composite is a good choice; it is less complex in this situation to treat primitives and composites as homogeneous.

Those are from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern" target="_blank">Wiki</a>. The most intelligent source.
