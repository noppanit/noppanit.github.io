I got this problems before, because I accidentally deleted files from my computer while I were holding the shife-key. So, I tried hard to restore them. I found this program which is quite useful and pretty small. You don&#8217;t have to install anything on your computer just use it. Moreover, you can permanently delete it from your hard drive.

Ps. Do not turn off your computer. What&#8217;s more, do not copy or move any files in your computer, because they would replaced the old files which you wanted to restore.
