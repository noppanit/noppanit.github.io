Ever wondered why all my chinese, korean or even Thai songs displayed strangely in iTunes. Or it worked before when I was using Windows, now it doesn&#8217;t on my Mac. Or when I installed Windows from China it worked, but now it doesn&#8217;t. The main point is those song names are in unicode format. So? We just have to changed it the format that our machine can understand. Yeh, what do I use? 

I found a very simple application to do that job well. It&#8217;s cheap and does the job well.
