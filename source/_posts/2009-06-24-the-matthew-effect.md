I have found this interesting effect on &#8220;The EconomicNaturalist WHY ECONOMICS EXPLAINS ALMOST EVERYTHING&#8221;

It explains that why &#8220;the rich get richer and the poor get poorer&#8221; of the Matthe effect, so I will quote the statement from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect" target="_blank">Wiki </a>first.

The **Matthew effect** in [sociology][1] is the phenomenon that &#8220;the rich get richer and the poor get poorer&#8221;. Those who possess power and [economic][2] or [social][3] capital can leverage those resources to gain more power or capital. The Matthew effect results in a [power law][4] distribution of resources. The term was first coined by sociologist [Robert K. Merton][5] and takes its name from a line in the [biblical][6] [Gospel of Matthew][7]:  
For the example, the book explains that why is it easier to find a partner when you already have one?. The situation begins at a man asked an attractive woman to meet at the bar at one night. When the twos met at the bar, suddendly the woman caressed his arm, gazed lovingly into his eyes and whispered frequently in his ear. The she announced her departure, asking him to meet her for coffee the next day. What happens next? Most of the women in that bar made contact with the man.

Why?  
&#8216;It&#8217;s hard to tell whether someone&#8217;s OK just by looking at him&#8217; the woman said. But because of the fact that she, an attractive woman, was paying such close attention to a man she obviously knew well was a credible signal that he was OK.
