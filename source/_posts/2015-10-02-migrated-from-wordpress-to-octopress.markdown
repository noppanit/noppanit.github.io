I have heard so much about Octopress and I haven't got the time to actually get to know what it can do. This week I finally make the time to migrate my blog to Octopress and I love it. Thanks to [HabitRPG][1] and Pomodoro. 

Don't get me wrong I still love WordPress. In fact, I'm actually a WordPress Developer myself. However, for the post 9 years that I have noppanit.com I haven't really used any of the WordPress features. What I really need is just a blog that I can write and publig. Octopress serves me well. 

Here are some of the reasons why I migrated my blog to Octopress

## Hosting
Hosting is nice but it would be nicer if I don't have to maintain. I chose to deploy my blog to Github as it's the fatest option and I don't need anything else just github.com which I use it everyday. Now, I don't have to worry about upgrading my plugins or WordPress anymore, even though usually my hosting would do it for me if I haven't updated for a long time. 

Octopress makes it really easy to upload anything. 

## Writing code
I think this is personally, because any good WordPress developer might argue that you can do the same in WordPress editor which I agree. However, having written a lot of MarkDown on Github I'm just used to use codeblock like this. 

## Performance
There's nothing faster than plain HTML. All my stuff is backed up and secure in Github. 

Here's some of the performance breakdown which I haven't tuned. 

One can argue that WordPress can do the same as well, but it's just a lot easier in Octopress.
