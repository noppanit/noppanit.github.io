Everybody might say, why would you want to be in Prague in December where it&#8217;s cold and depressing. If you&#8217;re lucky like me, you would find a sunny day when you can walk around in the Christmas market. I say Prague it&#8217;s the place where you can visit anytime you want. Even though, the weather can be a bit tricky, but you still have a lot to do in Prague or even in Czech Republic.
