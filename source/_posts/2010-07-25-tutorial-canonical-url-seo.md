I think this one is no need to write anything. In google blogs explains pretty much everything. 

What you would like to know is just be careful when your websites has more than URL that display the same content or at least pretty much the same content. Be aware that will affect your ranking, canonical URL is the way to tell google bot that those pages have preferred URL to display.
