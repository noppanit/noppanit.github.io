I think Semantic Web has been introduced to us for quite a long time, but we still haven&#8217;t seen a practical example before. So, I&#8217;m trying to experiment a little bit with my new website that I&#8217;ve just created for my friend. It&#8217;s [Siripachai Agency][1]. Basically, It&#8217;s a website for any students that want to study aboard in London. Firstly, I will use microdata on http://www.siripachai.com/abouts first. by following this example. <http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=146861>

And this is the before that I get out of Google search result.

Will upload as soon as google picks up the new microdata that I&#8217;ve just uploaded. Hope it works!
