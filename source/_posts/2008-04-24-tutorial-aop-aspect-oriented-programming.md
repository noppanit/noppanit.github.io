Last night, I was amazed by [Spring Framework][1], I have been reading this book for four hours and I ended up with [AOP][2]. I would like to summary my thoughts through this website. I will come back and write again this evening.

However, I cannot, in the name of god, explain these definitions better than this man. [P&#8217;Chanwit&#8217;s blog][3]  
He explained the definitions very clearly. Moreover, this is from <a href="http://www.narisa.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=11868" target="_blank">Narisa.com blog</a>. So, I would not be competitive.

I will present an easier example later in the next topic.
