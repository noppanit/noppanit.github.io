[NHibernate][1] for .NET is the project under control of [Hibernate.org][2]

NHinernate handles presistent pain in .NET, it handles and help us coding easily. While you can see [Nhibernate&#8217;s Architecture][3]. Before, when we want to connect database we must write connection string and sql statement yourself, After ORM (Object Relational Mapping) releases, we do not write it just write mapping file, in XML file, and NHibernate will organize and mapping by itself. It very easily tool to use. Here is [NHibernate document][4]
