If you are a programmer or work that is It-related, there&#8217;s a chance that you will come across open sources. If you use Firefox then you have used an open source already. I got a chance to attend  
Mozilla Festival 2013 in London and I found one desk hidden around the conner with a sign that said &#8220;Get Involved&#8221; I was wondering what kind of involvement was that. So I asked and the guy at the table said if you&#8217;re a programmer or wanted to learn how to code just help us fix some bugs. 

The guy gave me a link [Bugs Ahoy][1] which you can find some bugs on Mozilla projects and help them fix that bug. I&#8217;m particular interested in mobile development so I chose [this][2] to fix bugs on mobile. If you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re looking for that try [this][3]. The site will help narrow down your interest and tell you what to do next. What I think it&#8217;s the most interesting bit is [this][4]. You can find some bugs and if you don&#8217;t even know where to start you will have a mentor who can hold your hands till you finish the bug. After I picked a bug, you sent an email to my mentor immediately and got almost like a step-by-step instructions on how to fix the bug. 

Why am I talking about this? This is how open source community works. You release something and you let the community help you to finish it or even test it, provide feedback and fix it. Imagine if you&#8217;re a company and you only have 2 developers to do the job, but this you have the whole world to do your job. It&#8217;s also a good starting point if you want to learn a new language or new technology.

**Have fun and learn from the community**
