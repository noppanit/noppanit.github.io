**Problem**

I believe everyone has the same problem once in a while or often that you forget your phone charger. Or even you didn&#8217;t forget your phone charger if you travel between UK and Europe you might forget the converter or adapter. If you stay in a hotel you must have seen one of those Shaver-only outlets. You would think that it&#8217;s clearly said that it&#8217;s for shaver only. So, I cannot use it for anything else. One day, I travel from Europe to the UK and the socket is different. Europe has one of those two-prong socket, and in the UK they use the big three-leg socket. 

Then what can you do? I did some research on some myths. I have also tried it myself. It&#8217;s ok to charge your phone with those sockets. 

**Solution**

Modern adapter if you flip it up and have a look you will see this sign or similar to this. &#8220;Travel adapter 110V &#8211; 240V&#8221; What this means is that this adapter will transform the current range from 110 &#8211; 220V to be usable for your appliance. There&#8217;s a reference [here][1]. However, those outlets are not suitable for charging your big electronic equipments such as laptop or blow dryer. Once in a while it should be ok to use the outlet to charge your phone. Especially, if you travel from Europe you must have the two-prong socket adapter which is suitable for the outlet.
