According to my recently post, I developing windows application with bar code, So this topic will show you how to write application generate bar code on your own.

A theory of this method is use 39 bar code true type font, which you can download it from the internet. Then, Convert the things you type from keyboard, such as &#8220;0001&#8221; or &#8220;ABCDE&#8221; or human readable code, and turn it to bar code.
