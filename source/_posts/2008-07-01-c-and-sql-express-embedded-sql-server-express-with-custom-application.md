Well, with my &#8220;Trinop&#8221; project that is built with C# .NET and SQL Server Express edition. However, the diffcult part is that when I deploy the application to end-user, the installation is very hard, becuase the use has to install SQL Server first and the install my program. At least, it&#8217;s hard for some people. So, the problem can be solved by installing SQL Server in silence mode. Therefore, the installation will be done by just one click.

This is the example I have found.
