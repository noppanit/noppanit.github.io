This is the best chocolate I have ever taste.

Ingredients  
1. Chocolate powder  
2. Semi-skimmed milk  
3. Chocolate moose

1. Simmer semi-skimmed milk until you can see a little bubbles come out, but not boil it until the boiling point  
2. 2 tablespoons of chocolate powder and add the simmering milk  
3. decorate chocolate moose on top of the chocolate milk  
4. sprinkle a little bit of chocolate powder as in the picture
