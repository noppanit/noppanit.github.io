I would like to just contribute more to the bouldering in Istanbul. Since, I have been in Istanbul for over a month and I like bouldering. However, after a bit of searching I found little information about bouldering gyms in Istanbul. So far, I have been to two gyms and I&#8217;d like to share one of them first. 

It&#8217;s called [Boulder Istanbul][1].

**How to get there**  
This one is quite easy to get to and the location on the map below is quite accurate. I have checked in myself. 

You can get the metro to Kadıköy and then walk from there for only 10-15 minutes or you can get the metrobus to Söğütlüçeşme which is the terminal station at the Asian side and then walk for 15-20 minutes. It&#8217;s quite a nice walk through kebab shops.

**Price**  
It&#8217;s only 15 TL for a day pass.
