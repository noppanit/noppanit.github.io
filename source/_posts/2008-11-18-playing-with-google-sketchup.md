I having a dream about having a English-style home with my girlfriend. So, I decided to sketch the structure myself. As I am not a archiecture and not familar with any sophisticated tools such as Auto CAD or something like that. But this application is just right for an amature like me. <http://sketchup.google.com/> .

It&#8217;s easy to sketch something up like the name and is totally free. But if you need a little more extra you have to pay.

These are the video tutorials that you can learn how to use the software. As google said, no matter how good the application is, if you don&#8217;t know how to use it. It&#8217;s just useless. I like that.
