I recently moved to NYC and I just got a pre-paid T-Mobile just to try it out how it goes. And this is what I tweeted and got a reply back from T-Mobile. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After just one week of <a href="https://twitter.com/TMobile">@TMobile</a> in NYC. I&#39;m not quite impressed with the coverage. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hmm?src=hash">#hmm</a></p>&mdash; Noppanit (Toy) (@noppanit) <a href="https://twitter.com/noppanit/status/519437198610137088">October 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

I think they might have got hundred of tweets a day. So they might have slipped. The first when I read this I quickly scrolled up to see if I got a typo. But they&#8217;re right though I chose T-Mobile. Just a little laugh for me today.
