I recently moved to NYC and I just got a pre-paid T-Mobile just to try it out how it goes. And this is what I tweeted and got a reply back from T-Mobile. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

I think they might have got hundred of tweets a day. So they might have slipped. The first when I read this I quickly scrolled up to see if I got a typo. But they&#8217;re right though I chose T-Mobile. Just a little laugh for me today.
