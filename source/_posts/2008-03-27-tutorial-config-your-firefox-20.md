I am the one like every one else who doesn&#8217;t like IE. I have been using Firefox 2.0 for 2 years. It is very good, faster, more reliable, more plugin than IE, personally. However, when I am using firefox with some websites, such as telegraph.co.uk, or manager.co.th. I don&#8217;t know why, my Firefox have eaten up approximately 200MB of my ram, and boost my CPU to 100%. So, when I was reading news on the websites, I cannot work with other applications. I tried telegraph.co.uk with IE 6.0. It didn&#8217;t have any problem like my Firefox. Hence, I have been searching google and found this website which I think it works very well. [LifeHacker][1]

You can your firefox to limit the use of RAM.
