**Cabbage: for food poisoning  
**Well-cooked cabbage and the water it&#8217;s been boiled in are effective at clearing up minor diarrhoea and sickness caused by food poisoning. &#8220;White cabbage, in particular, is very high in sulphur, which helps destroy harmful bacteria in your stomach,&#8221; says Susie Perry from nutrition therapy clinic Smart Nutrition. Try to eat at least three large tablespoons of thoroughly boiled leaves, or sip a cup of the cooking water.

**Walnuts: for winter blues**  
&#8220;Walnuts are a fantastic source of zinc, amino acids and omega 3 and 6, which help prevent depression,&#8221; says pharmacist Margo Marrone of the Organic Pharmacy, which is dedicated to organic health and beauty treatments. &#8220;Walnuts influence the levels of serotonin in the brain and help to nourish the nervous system. You should aim to eat a small handful every day. &#8221; Other feelgood foods include flax seed, almonds and sunflower seeds, which are high in tryptophan, an essential amino acid that increases the production of serotonin.

**Cinnamon: for bloating and indigestion  
**Research has shown that this aromatic spice helps inhibit the growth or E coli when added to food. It encourages the digestive system to work efficiently and can be used to treat indigestion and flatulence. &#8216;And because it improves appetite, it&#8217;s also an effective herb to use when recovering from a cold or flu,&#8217; says medical herbalist Dr An Walker. Stir a half-teaspoon of powder into a warm drink or porridge every morning.?? Use only small amounts and do not take it you&#8217;re pregnant.

**Horse Chestnut: for aching joints and muscles  
**Horse chestnut strengthens the walls of small blood vessels and helps treat aching muscles, varicose veins and swollen ankles caused by weakened veins.
