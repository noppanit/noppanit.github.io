Last year, I brought my first digital camera from my brother in 15,000 Bath. It is Fiji [finepix s9500][1]

I was so happy with my first digital camera, but I don&#8217;t have any idea to use that camera. I want to introduce my first knowledge in this blog about focus length, the number beside every lens on digital camera. Ex, 28mm &#8211; 300mm. What doesn&#8217;t it mean. I have an answer.
