## Should you pay in local or home currency while travelling?
Short answer. Pay in local currency. For example, I have a credit card from the US and I'm going to be in Hong Kong for my vacation. I should pay in Hong Kong dollar. 

Long answer. There's something about [DCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_currency_conversion) that you have to pay a small fee for the customer to see the amount in home currency in the receipt. Here's an example.

If I had paid in US dollar, I would have paid \\$0.81 more. It doesn't seem like a lot but it definitely adds up. I checked my credit card transaction and it showed \\$19.33. It's also good if you can get the card that doesn't charge foreign transaction fee.
