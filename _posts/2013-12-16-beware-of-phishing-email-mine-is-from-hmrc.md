Lately, I have been swamped by phishing emails from HMRC or pretend-to-be HMRC. At first, I was thinking it was probable legit because I had just filed my Tax to HMRC and a couple weeks later I got email from this refunds@hmrc.gov.uk and just for a glance I thought hmrc.gov.uk it&#8217;s probably be real. But after a quick google. I found [this][1] and [this][2]. 

Another way to look at the links is to just hover over the links and you will see something that&#8217;s not from HMRC at all. So, please be careful not to fall into something like this.
