I have been travelling a lot due to work and sometimes I&#8217;m tried of getting to the airport, catching the train or getting on a crowded bus. So, I thought it would be nice just to get away. And just a couple hours I was in Luxembourg the country where people go there to just tick the box.

> One important thing is that if you have a connection at Charles de Gaulle International Airport at Paris. Please spare some time at least 1 hour even though it&#8217;s just one building away. The airport is really big and maybe you have to pass the security check again after you landed. I almost missed my connection because I thought it&#8217;s just 2F and 2D how long would it take to walk. It&#8217;s actually about 20 min walk-and-run. 

After I landed, the airport is small and not much to see or shop. Without hesitation, for a be-backpacker like me taxi is out of the question. Luxembourg airport has direct buses to the city centre. Just hop on the bus there and tell the driver **main train station or hauptbahnhof**. They use French as the main language but everybody understands German.

And yeh as I said I was bored with the city so I arrived at the main train station and headed straight to the bus stop to get on the bus number 111 or 110 to Echternach for [Mullerthal Trail][1]. The ticket is just 2 Euro and the journey takes about 45 min. It&#8217;s a really good deal.

After arriving at the village the temperature was about 2 degree it&#8217;s nice and chilly. I was at the wrong time because it was December and it&#8217;s not the best time for Luxembourg but I still think it&#8217;s really worth a visit for a nice forest walking. Got off the bus and the first thing you will notice is the sign to Mullerthal Trail, so no need to ask anybody just look around a little bit. I found the trail was quite easy and the rock formations are really beautiful. I think you could camp there as well if you&#8217;re well prepared.

I walked from Echternach to Berdorf because I didn&#8217;t have enough time. The day was short during the winter and I didn&#8217;t want to spend a night there without something warm. From Berform you can get a bus back to Luxembourg City easily with the same bus number 110 or 111.
