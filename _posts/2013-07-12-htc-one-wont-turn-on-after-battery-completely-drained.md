This has just happened to be last night when I was on a phone and I didn&#8217;t notice that my battery was about to run out. So, I kept talking and suddenly my phone went off. I quickly plugged my phone into the wall charger again and push the power button in hope that it would give me the HTC One logo once again. But my hope was in vain, nothing showed up it was just a blank black screen. This has to me before when I was using Blackberry Bold 9700. What I did was that I pulled the battery out and put it back in again, and it worked. Now, HTC One doesn&#8217;t have back cover so you cannot pull the battery out. I searched all over the Internet but no luck as the phone is quite new and I guess no one has been this dumb like me. Here&#8217;s what I did to get my phone back on again.

1. Charge your phone to the wall charger again for at least 1 hour just to give your battery a kick.  
2. Press the **Volume Down** button and press the **Power** button together for as long as you can. Some says for 10 seconds but for me it was longer than that.  
3. If you&#8217;re lucky you phone will turn on and give you some options. You can choose **Fast boot** by using **Volume Up/Down** button to choose between options and use the **Power** button to select.  
4. And yeh! Your phone will reboot. Never ever let your battery die again.
