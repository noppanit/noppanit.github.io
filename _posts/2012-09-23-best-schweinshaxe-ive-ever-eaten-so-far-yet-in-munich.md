Well, as the title says this was the best Pork Knuckles I have ever eaten in Munich, Germany. I love food and I love good food. So I always find good restaurants, sometimes I go for a michelin-star restaurant but you can&#8217;t do that everyday. I was in Okterber Fest in Munich last week, but it was raining so I decided to find something bavarian to eat instead. I googled for a few and I decided to go for this place &#8220;[Haxnbauer][1]&#8220;. They don&#8217;t have a website so this is the only link I can find.

The cracking is crispy and the sauce is just right with the meat. With Weissbier is just perfect.
