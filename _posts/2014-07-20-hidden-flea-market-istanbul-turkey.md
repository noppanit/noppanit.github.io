Love flea market? Love antiques? And you are in Istanbul, you should try out this place if you like antique stuff and what to kill a couple hours on a Sunday in Istanbul. The market opens every Sunday. I don&#8217;t know what time but I was there from 12pm &#8211; 3pm. I don&#8217;t really know how to get there by public transportation, but you can get a taxi to there from Şişli Metro station. It&#8217;s only a couple minutes away by taxi.
