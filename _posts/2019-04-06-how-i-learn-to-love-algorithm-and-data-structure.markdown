For the past few years I have had a love-hate relationship with tech interview. 

## What is deliberate practice?

## How to adapt to day to day work.

I was forced to learn about multithreading and concurrency in a deeper level. I signed up for courses and it made me a better engineer in general. 

I understand algorithms and datastructures better in general. 

## Find the purpose.

Instead of fighting the system and fix from the bottom we should be fixing from the above. Right now, I don't have the power to change the system but once I got to the top I believe it will be easier to change the process. For example, once I become the hiring manager I can slowly change the process.
