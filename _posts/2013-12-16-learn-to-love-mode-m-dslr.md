If you have a DSLR or any mirror-less camera, there&#8217;s a good chance that you will have this &#8220;M&#8221; mode. It&#8217;s a mode where you can control shutter speed or aperture. It sounds scary for most people because at first I think I bought this quite expensive camera I think it should know best what&#8217;s good for my pictures. Mostly I want to just use either &#8220;A&#8221; for everyday shoot or &#8220;S&#8221; if I really want to control my shutter speed but rarely I use this mode. But after I have attended a flash photography course and learned to use &#8220;M&#8221; mode for a flash gun, the reason that the teacher gave us was that it consumes less battery which I think it&#8217;s not the case for camera. I was hooked up and how easy to use &#8220;M&#8221; mode and I transferred that knowledge to my DSLR.

## Why &#8220;M&#8221; mode is good?

I think this is quite personal. And if you have read blogs from most professionals they will suggest you should try &#8220;M&#8221; mode for better results or just to get used to it. I have been ignored that advice for years. Personally, the good things about manual mode is that you have control over your camera. Also, when you use a flash gun your camera doesn&#8217;t know it. If you shoot in dark and use &#8220;A&#8221; mode your camera will measure the light as very dark and will try to adjust your shutter speed lower. Another good point for me is that it&#8217;s easier and more granular to adjust your stop than exposure. For example, if you shoot in &#8220;A&#8221; or &#8220;S&#8221; and you think your picture is either over or under exposure you will try to increase or decrease your exposure and sometimes I feel like it&#8217;s not what I really want after adjusted it, but adjusting either shutter speed or aperture to me feels more natural. 

## How I shoot in &#8220;M&#8221; mode

First I look at the light conditions to use my judgement about my lights. If it&#8217;s sunny I will base my aperture between F5.6 to F8 or even F11 and then shutter speed around 1/250 so my picture won&#8217;t get blurry. Then I shoot. Then I see if I like it or not, if not I will adjust either aperture or shutter speed. Remember to adjust one thing at a time, because it&#8217;s easier to remember. Luckily, we shoot in digital now so we can erase unwanted images immediately. If I&#8217;m comfortable with the picture now I will shoot with that settings until the light conditions change and start the process again. For example, if suddenly a cloud is in the way they you need to go up one or two stops. Practice like this for a day and you will get used to it gradually. I think it&#8217;s much more fun. 

If it&#8217;s a bit shady or poor light conditions I will increase my ISO first to 400 or 600 then repeat the same process.

**Updated** As my colleague pointed out after a few hours, the point is to have fun and play with your camera. Enjoy his [post][1] which is to have fun with &#8220;A&#8221; or &#8220;S&#8221; mode.
