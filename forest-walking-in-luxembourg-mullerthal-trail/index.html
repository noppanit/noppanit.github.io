<p>I have been travelling a lot due to work and sometimes I’m tried of getting to the airport, catching the train or getting on a crowded bus. So, I thought it would be nice just to get away. And just a couple hours I was in Luxembourg the country where people go there to just tick the box.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One important thing is that if you have a connection at Charles de Gaulle International Airport at Paris. Please spare some time at least 1 hour even though it’s just one building away. The airport is really big and maybe you have to pass the security check again after you landed. I almost missed my connection because I thought it’s just 2F and 2D how long would it take to walk. It’s actually about 20 min walk-and-run.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After I landed, the airport is small and not much to see or shop. Without hesitation, for a be-backpacker like me taxi is out of the question. Luxembourg airport has direct buses to the city centre. Just hop on the bus there and tell the driver <strong>main train station or hauptbahnhof</strong>. They use French as the main language but everybody understands German.</p>

<p>And yeh as I said I was bored with the city so I arrived at the main train station and headed straight to the bus stop to get on the bus number 111 or 110 to Echternach for <a href="http://www.mullerthal-trail.lu/en/" title="Mullerthal Trail">Mullerthal Trail</a>. The ticket is just 2 Euro and the journey takes about 45 min. It’s a really good deal.</p>

<p>After arriving at the village the temperature was about 2 degree it’s nice and chilly. I was at the wrong time because it was December and it’s not the best time for Luxembourg but I still think it’s really worth a visit for a nice forest walking. Got off the bus and the first thing you will notice is the sign to Mullerthal Trail, so no need to ask anybody just look around a little bit. I found the trail was quite easy and the rock formations are really beautiful. I think you could camp there as well if you’re well prepared.</p>

<p><a href="#" rel="attachment wp-att-1015"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1015 cool_border alignnone" alt="Mullerthal Trail" src="https://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/IMG_0002_edited-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>

<p>I walked from Echternach to Berdorf because I didn’t have enough time. The day was short during the winter and I didn’t want to spend a night there without something warm. From Berform you can get a bus back to Luxembourg City easily with the same bus number 110 or 111.</p>
