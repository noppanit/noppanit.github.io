    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>If you don&#8217;t know <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/">Code Review Stackoverflow</a> you gotta get on it now. It works and it&#8217;s awesome.</p>

<h2>Longer version</h2>

<p>In Agile world, everybody is talking about fail fast and faster feedback. If you&#8217;re a serious coder then code review and feedback are just as important. If you&#8217;re like me (maybe I&#8217;m alone), I used to hate code review so much because I don&#8217;t want someone to criticize my work, coding is like an art. You spent a lot of time on a piece of code and somebody just come in and say it sucks or why would you do something like that?. Not everybody is a great coder like Linus Torvalds or Ryan Dahl. Especially me, Because of rigorous code review I came from the worst coder every to bad coder (I&#8217;m still bad and I&#8217;m still learning). I believe the best way to learn any skill is first you have to be wrong and learn from your mistakes. The quickest way to do that is to code a lot and get your code reviewed by someone who&#8217;s a stronger coder than you, which you will have a lot on the Internet. If you work with some of the best programmers in your life then you&#8217;re lucky. But not everybody is that fortunate. I&#8217;ve found a better solution. <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/">http://codereview.stackexchange.com/</a></p>

<h2>Let&#8217;s get to the meat</h2>

<p>For example, I wrote this piece of code to learn about dynamic programming.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I know that my code is not bad (or maybe is really bad), but let&#8217;s see what I get out of it from this <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/92811/find-the-minimum-number-of-coins">thread</a>. From within a day I have at least 2-3 points to make my code a lot better. Not only that I learn more about Python, I also learn how to optimize the script.</p>

<p>If you want to learn a new language fast, you need to learn from the expert. In just a few days I improved my code substantially. The best thing about the Internet is, you will have someone to review the reviewer as well. So, you can be sure to some extent that the one who answered your question is trustworthy.</p>

<p>Now you might wonder, how about <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a>? I use Stackoverflow too but Stackoverflow has its own purpose. If you&#8217;re stuck in some problem and you can&#8217;t really wrap your head around it posting to Stackoverflow will give you answer in no time. However, if you ask somebody on Stackoverflow to review your code, it&#8217;s likely that your thread will be voted down or closed.</p>

<h2>What about if you only have an idea.</h2>

<p>I always have new idea and somehow I want experts to review or confirm my idea so I don&#8217;t waste time building something that somebody has done it before. Then, Stackoverflow or codereview.stackoverflow.com is not really the place you&#8217;d go for. That&#8217;s what I love about <a href="http://Quora.com">Quora.com</a>.</p>

<p>For example, I wanted to understand more about machine learning and I couldn&#8217;t really ask on <a href="http://stats.stackexchange.com">stats.stackexchange.com</a>. That&#8217;s why I turned to Quora. For example, this <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-if-I-want-to-build-a-model-to-predict-if-a-tweet-will-go-viral/answer/Shankar-Iyer-5?__snids__=1350032536&amp;__nsrc__=2">thread</a>, I got a really detailed response from whom I can trust because of the number of upvotes.</p>

<h2>Some note</h2>

<p>I have one bad habit of just copying and pasting someone else&#8217;s code. Once you received the feedback, don&#8217;t just copy and paste that. Or if you get feedback from Github don&#8217;t just merge that right away. You will not fully understand the concept behind that. In the book I read recently, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/039916524X/sciencefriday/">A Mind For Numbers</a>, Barbara taught us about how we can master in math and science and she explains that we have two modes of learning, focused and diffuse mode. If you just copy and paste someone else&#8217;s work, then you just imagine that you understand what&#8217;s going on. The best way to learn that is to actually do it and go into diffuse mode which is just close your eyes and think about it and go back to focused mode to do that again. I made a big mistake as an Engineer (I still do) that I just copy someone else&#8217;s code and I think that I understand that fully which I don&#8217;t. So, don&#8217;t just copy the feedback and commit that make sure you fully understand the code and actually type it. Barbara also suggested that writing is better than just typing but I think it might be difficult for us programmers.</p>

    <link href="http://www.noppanit.com/maps-all-parking-signs-in-nyc/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.noppanit.com/maps-all-parking-signs-in-nyc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post might be too easy for any Data-viz people but as a beginner tapping in this area. It took me quite a long time to figure it out so I just want to share this hoping that it might save people&#8217;s time.</p>

<p>Parking in NYC is really a pain, especially street parking where there&#8217;re lots of signs and regulations. There are some apps on Android and iPhone that you can download and see signs but I haven&#8217;t been able to find the one that suits my needs. I want an application that can tell me where to circle arounds on which day and time to find parking spot. For example, I parked my car on a Tuesday which has street cleaning on Wednesday and Friday from 8:30 to 9:30. That means I have to move the car on Wednesday morning to find a spot for Friday. The problem is I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s around me. The closest application I find is <a href="http://www.nycparklife.com/streetparker/">http://www.nycparklife.com/streetparker/</a> which it doesn&#8217;t have Manhattan.</p>

<h2>Getting the data</h2>

<p>So, I googled and thank NYC.gov that provides the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#parking">data</a> for us. First, I played around with the csv files but they don&#8217;t have coordinates that I can place location on the map. And I have no experience dealing with shapefiles.</p>

<h2>Extracting the data</h2>

<p>After a few hours of mangling and munching the csv with Pandas and R. I would not be able to get the exact locations of all the signs. So I turned to shapefile hoping that I might get lucky. And I found this <a href="http://www.shpescape.com/">http://www.shpescape.com/</a> which promised to transform shapefile to <a href="https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en">Google Fusion Table</a>. Awesome! I went ahead and tried it. It works great! but it only gives you the first 100,000 rows. So dug deeper. After another few hours of googling I found <a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/">qGis</a> which is a opensource project that you can use to open and view shapefile.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the example.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-12.52.32.png"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-12.52.32.png" alt="Parking signs on Qgis" width="1008" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1466" /></a></p>

<p>One thing I learnt was that you cannot just click <strong>Open</strong> and choose the file. What you need to do is to <string>Add Vector Layer</strong>. You can use shortcut <strong>Ctrl+Shift+v</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-12.55.56.png"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-12.55.56.png" alt="Add Vector Layer" width="1433" height="836" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1467" /></a></p>

<h2>Export to Google Fusion</h2>

<p>Now what we need is to import what we have to Google Fusion Table. How are we going to turn this beautiful layer to Google Maps. We need CSV&#8230;</p>

<p>In QGis you can download the file as CSV. It&#8217;s in <strong>Layer > Save As</strong>. You just need to make sure that <strong>Geometry</strong> has to be set so you get the coordinates.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.02.06.png"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.02.06.png" alt="Save to CSV" width="591" height="652" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1468" /></a></p>

<h2>Import to Google Fusion Table</h2>

<p>Now we can use that CSV to import to Google Fusion. It would look something like this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.04.35.png"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.04.35.png" alt="Google Fusion Table" width="1425" height="726" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1469" /></a></p>

<p>what you need to make sure is that you need to specify which fields are Lat, Long so Google can plot that for you.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how you do it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.05.41.png"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.05.41.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-07-30 13.05.41" width="226" height="116" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1470" /></a></p>

<p>The click <strong>change</strong> You will see something like this and you can choose which field you want to be Longitude or Latitude.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.06.33.png"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.06.33.png" alt="Set Location" width="518" height="673" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1471" /></a></p>

<p>Once the coordinates have set we can go to Map tab and see beautiful little dots that show where all the signs are in NYC.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.07.47.png"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-30-13.07.47.png" alt="Parking signs in Google Fusion Table" width="1254" height="736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1472" /></a>.</p>

<p>Walla! Now you have something you can build an application on top of it. The next post, I will create an application on top of this map to make use of our data.</p>

<h2>Things I have tried and failed</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried using <a href="https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4">Proj4</a> on both R and Python to convert X,Y WGS84 to Lat, Long. Here&#8217;s my little snippet.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The result is not quite accurate which I think it&#8217;s because I need to find a correct <strong>proj4string</strong>.</p>

<p>Python has the same wrapper which is quite what I want as well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, the title might be a little bit exaggerating. But let me clear this up first. I still use modern editors, TextMate, Atom.io or IntelliJ. They are pros and cons. But here&#8217;s my real answer if people ask me. I want to be the cool kid!.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re like me but I get asked almost all the time I go to a meetup or conference, &#8220;What&#8217;s your favourite editor&#8221;?. People almost always say Vim|Emacs. I tried both of them in the past and gave up more than I can remember because of all the shortcuts and plugins and I just get too frustrated to use either of them. Finally, I have made a decision that I&#8217;m going to stick with Vim for a month and let&#8217;s see if at the end of the month I still can&#8217;t use it. It&#8217;s been almost a month and I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m never going back to modern editors again (at least when I&#8217;m coding scripting languages). Here&#8217;s why.</p>

<h3>It&#8217;s just easier</h3>

<p>I know it&#8217;s not really easier than TextMate or Sublime. You still have to learn a lot of shortcuts and commands. Also, bare-bone Vim just doesn&#8217;t have when you get in TextMate or Sublime (e.g, Find file, Command+T, Directory structure or code completion). However, after you powered through that learning phrase everything is just natural to you.</p>

<p>If you want to clear any trailing whitespaces you just have to type <strong>%s/\s+$//</strong> and hit enter. If you want to run some external command you can always do in Vim. For example, if you just want to <strong>git status</strong> you can install <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Git wrapper</a> or you can just run <strong>:!git status</strong>. You don&#8217;t even need to go to your terminal which I think it&#8217;s faster.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a good engineer, you will always do TDD. Going back and fourth between the editor and terminal, it&#8217;s just too annoying. I remember when I was coding Java I can just hit Cmd+t in IntelliJ or .NET and you see green bars. Isn&#8217;t it just awesome? I realised that TextMate and Sublime have plugins to do that as well or you can just write your own plugin or package. I tried a couple of plugins and they never work for me. In Vim, it just works!.</p>

<h3>Community</h3>

<p>If Vim|Emacs doesn&#8217;t do what you want, you will almost always find the plugin that does it for you. Currently, my standard plugins are. <strong>NERDTree</strong>, <strong>CommandT</strong>, <strong>vim-fugitive</strong>, <strong>vim-rooter</strong>, <strong>vim-virtualenv</strong>. All these plugins just make my Vim functions the same as Atom.io or Sublime.</p>

<h3>Not for everyone</h3>

<p>I have to admit that the first few weeks I got really frustrated. I almost banged my keyboard against the monitor. I found myself opening Atom.io every time I couldn&#8217;t do some basic editing in Vim. For example, using <strong>vimgrep</strong> wasn&#8217;t what I expected and I ended up googling a lot. Now I get the hang of it and I don&#8217;t use Atom anymore. The worst case is I will just use command line instead.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of TDD. I get nervous every time when I put some code it without having tests. I&#8217;m developing a simple jQuery plugin and I think hey we can TDD this.</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>The plugin is really simple. It turns ul tag to be taggable field. It&#8217;s similar to <a href="http://aehlke.github.io/tag-it/">tag-it</a> but with a lot less functionalities and doesn&#8217;t depend on jquery-ui</p>

<h2>What you need</h2>

<p>I decided to use Karma because I&#8217;m going to test a lot of behaviours and Karma seems like a good fit as it run on real browser. Here&#8217;s how I setup my project.</p>

<p>I chose jasmine-jquery because it&#8217;s easier to create some element to test and it&#8217;s easy to setup.</p>

<p>This is my <strong>gulpfile.js</strong></p>

    <link href="http://www.noppanit.com/the-most-basic-example-of-linear-regression/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.noppanit.com/the-most-basic-example-of-linear-regression</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just for fun, I wanted to learn how to do linear regression and here&#8217;s the example I come up with.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a historical data of 1000 people who dined in your restaurant and left a tip. This is going to be perfect data because I generated. In the real world you will not find something like this.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t understand Linear Regression like me before I wrote this post, I recommend you to read this <a href="http://onlinestatbook.com/2/regression/intro.html">basic linear regression.</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is that you have two variables. In this case, it&#8217;s <strong>tips</strong> and <strong>total amount of bill</strong>. You should explore the data by plotting the graph of these two variables. From my generated data you will get something like this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-07-00.54.42.png"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot-2015-07-07-00.54.42.png" alt="Linear Regression" width="421" height="281" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1448" /></a></p>

<p>You can clearly see that there&#8217;s a strong correlation between the amount of tip and meal.</p>

<p>Now if you can find the slope of the graph and intercept you should be able to use the formula.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Y = MX + C
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>M = slope of the graph
</span><span class='line'>C = Intercept</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you&#8217;re lazy to look at my <a href="https://github.com/noppanit/linear-regression-basic">notebook</a>.</p>

<p>Then you can run this code.</p>

<p>The result is $7 which corresponds to the 10% tip.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve just finished my first refactor to convert my node.js code to be more promisey (I believe that&#8217;s the word they use these days). There&#8217;s lots of documents out there to do this. However, I thought I should contribute more to help me understand more and might get some feedback from people who&#8217;s seen it as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m trying to create a bot to report me back the performance of my site in desktop and mobile mode. So, I thought it would be easy since Google has an <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v2/getting-started">API</a> for that already so I went ahead and did this.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy and straight forward right but now that would only return the score of desktop. I need the score of my mobile site as well. So, I added more code to be like this.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s great but I want to return both scores to a client so I can report the scores rather than printing them to the console. Since, <strong>request</strong> is asynchronous you cannot guarantee which score would come first. So, I thought it&#8217;s easy. I just need to call one request after the other. So, I came up with this.</p>

    <updated>2015-05-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.noppanit.com/rise-of-the-slackbots</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://fusion.net">Fusion</a> tech team just had a hackday in the theme of &#8220;Slackbot&#8221;. We brainstormed what or how do we make the job of editorial or engineering team easier. We threw a bunch of ideas and my team decided to create a bot that can interact with you in a number of ways or encourage you to fix or debug code. We tried to make it funny and in the same time useful for our daily routine.</p>

<p>My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/danielbachhuber">Daniel Bachhuber</a> came up with the name Rubberduck which I believe he got it from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">here</a>. The idea of the bot is easy. If you have used Slack you must have seen Slackbot before where it guides you how to use Slack or the bot can help you change your profile picture.</p>

<p>We spent a good one hour to find the best possible solution for creating a bot and we found <a href="https://github.com/silentrob/superscript/">Superscript</a>, which has a client for Slack. It&#8217;s perfect!.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve also opensourced the <a href="https://github.com/fusioneng/rubberduck-bot">bot</a> which you can clone and play around with it as well.</p>

<p>The first plugin we are thinking is performance bot where the bot can report the current performance of a website instead of going to a dashboard. It&#8217;s because we have remote team. So, having a bit giant board wouldn&#8217;t make much sense since some of our folks are distributed and we mainly use Slack for any communication.</p>

<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-1403" src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screenshot-2015-05-23-19.42.23.png" alt="rubberduck bot" width="501" height="86" /></p>

<p>Now, go ahead and create your own bot!.</p>

    <link href="http://www.noppanit.com/installing-ssl-on-amazon-cloudfront/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.noppanit.com/installing-ssl-on-amazon-cloudfront</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have just installed SSL on our Amazon CloudFront. We followed this <a href="https://bryce.fisher-fleig.org/blog/setting-up-ssl-on-aws-cloudfront-and-s3/">blog post</a> from Bryce which I think it&#8217;s really good already. However, I was stuck on the last part where you have to upload the certificate to IAM. The difference is that I had to concatenate the crt files myself and I didn&#8217;t know how to do it. So I spent quite a long time to figure it out. I thought I would write this so it might help save sometime for anybody.</p>

<p>If your SSL providers gave you the chained certificate already, then you don&#8217;t have to do anything else. However, when I downloaded my crt files I found this</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>my_domain.crt
</span><span class='line'>AddTrustExternalCARoot.crt
</span><span class='line'>TrustedSecureCertificateAuthority5.crt
</span><span class='line'>USERTrustRSAAddTrustCA.rt</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And I&#8217;m shocked. So, I thought I would need to upload all of them three times which I did but only one got through and I thought the others must have been backup or some kind (I know I&#8217;m pretty stupid). So, I used <a href="https://www.digicert.com/help/">SSL Checker</a> to check and the site said my trust is broken. I thought how could it be I did everything right.</p>

<p>It turned out that I didn&#8217;t upload all of the chained certificate. So, I went again and I tried to upload the second file which I got a nice error from Amazon that my certificate is malformed. I&#8217;m stumped again.</p>

<p>After a lot of digging and reading. I have to figured out the order of certificates and concatenate all the certificates in the right order until the root. You can ask your SSL provider if you want a quicker answer but I went the hard way.</p>

<p>You can run this command</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>openssl x509 -text -noout -in your_domain.crt
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You should start with your <strong>domain.crt</strong> file which will be something like this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You just need to look for Issuer which will tell you what is your next immediate certificate. In this case Trusted Secure Certificate Authority 5 is my first certificate and then you go on and do the next one.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>It means <strong>USERTrust</strong> is the next certificate then repeat the process again until you see this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If <strong>Issuer</strong> is the same as <strong>Subject</strong> that means this certificate is the root which is going to be the last. Now, what you can do is to concatenate in the correct order of all the certificates.</p>

<p>You can use this command or you can use your favourite editor to do as well.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>cat first_crt second_crt third_crt &gt; your_pem_file
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then when you&#8217;re ready to upload the certificate to Amazon you can just do this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>aws iam upload-server-certificate --server-certificate-name your_domain <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>--certificate-body file://your_domain.crt <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>--private-key file://your_domain.private <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>--certificate-chain file://your_pem_file <span class="se">\</span>
</span><span class='line'>--path /cloudfront/
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <strong>&#8211;certificate-chain</strong> should be your concatenated certificates.</p>

<p>The format of the <strong>pem</strong> should be something like this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

    <link href="http://www.noppanit.com/what-should-you-expect-for-salkantay-trek-to-machu-picchu/"/>
    <updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.noppanit.com/what-should-you-expect-for-salkantay-trek-to-machu-picchu</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not really a travel blogger but I&#8217;ll try to share my experience as much as possible. I&#8217;ve just come back from Peru (Machu Picchu). Me and a bunch of my friends did the Salkantay trek which hike from Cusco (sort of) to Machu Picchu. It&#8217;s a 5 days 4 nights trip. The hike is really challenging physically and mentally. You will experience altitude sickness and soreness from your body. Funny thing is I didn&#8217;t feel a thing at the highest peak, some of my friends experienced different symptoms. One of the best I&#8217;ve heard is; &#8220;It&#8217;s like EDM concert banging in my head&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Stay warm</h2>

<p>You really need to dress warm because you will be walking at the altitude around 14,000 feet which is going to be quite cold. I&#8217;d suggest a lot of layers instead of big puffy jacket. Base layer is really important and a good fleece. One thing that you can&#8217;t miss out is a good pair of wool socks.</p>

<h2>Prepare for the rain</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s going to rain. What you really need is a good rain jacket and or Pancho is you want. I find rain jacket is enough to keep you dry. However, what really important is waterproof hiking shoes or you need extra pairs of socks. If you have your camera, rain cover for your bag and camera are really crucial.</p>

<h2>Prepare for the altitude</h2>

<p>If you think you will be affected by the altitude, please consult with your doctor to get some pills. I didn&#8217;t really get any headache while hiking on the high altitude but everybody is different.</p>

<h2>What you don&#8217;t really need</h2>

<p>Water is what you really need. But you can get water at every stop along the trail. What you don&#8217;t really need is water purification. However, it&#8217;s just a small pack if you don&#8217;t mind carrying that.</p>

<h2>Pack light</h2>

<p>I found myself overpack for the hike and I exhausted myself on the third day. If you think you&#8217;re going to need snacks. I suggest having <a href="http://www.starburst.com/">starburst</a>. My friend gave away two starbursts at every stop point which I think they really keep me going in terms of energy. I had my raw almonds and dry berries which helped a lot.</p>

<h2>Sleep comfy</h2>

<p>Sleeping bag is a must. However, I had a really good night sleep with my <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/866771/sea-to-summit-aeros-pillow-premium">camping pillow</a> and it&#8217;s inflatable and really light.</p>

<h2>Taking pictures of the locals</h2>

<p>If you walk around in Cusco, you might find local people dressing in traditional custom. If you take a picture of them, they might ask you for some money. I gave them 1 soles and it was enough. And make sure you ask their permission before you take a picture of them.</p>

<h2>Coca leaves</h2>

<p>The locals told us to chew coca leaves to prevent the tiredness and altitude sickness. To be honest, they didn&#8217;t help much but I really like the coca tea in the morning.</p>

<h2>Local food</h2>

<p>Peruvian cuisine is really interesting or at least from my point of view. I had Guinea pig and Alpaca. I like Alpaca but the Guinea pig is not really my jam. At least I tried.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Everybody loves sticky bar. Or I should say every UX loves sticky bar. You probable have seen that from almost all major websites. Twitter or Facebook all has the top nav bar which sticks to the top and follows you when you scroll down the page. However, there&#8217;s one thing that I have noticed if you use Google Chrome Dev Tool to see the paint area. You will see that the nav bar gets repaint every time you scroll up and down.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screenshot_2015-04-14_01_13_55.png"></p>

<p>Also, if you use Timeline to record the activity you will notice a lot of Repaint happening which leads to bad scrolling performance.</p>

<p>The easy fix would be to put</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='css'><span class='line'><span class="nt">backface-visibility</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">hidden</span><span class="o">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>on your navbar which will stop the repaint on scroll.</p>

<h3>Why that fixes it?</h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to try answer this myself as this <a href="http://benfrain.com/improving-css-performance-fixed-position-elements/">article</a> answers everything.</p>

<p>to the navbar and you can measure the performance by using Timeline again you will notice the difference.</p>

    <id>http://www.noppanit.com/you-should-check-in-your-dependencies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure who started this pattern so I can&#8217;t really refer back but if you know please comment below and I will update the post. I&#8217;m sure all of you have heard that you should not check in anything that can be generated to Source control. It&#8217;s long been a common pattern. However, lately I have been checking in my dependencies into my source control and it works really well for small to medium project. Here&#8217;s why.</p>

<h3>Isolate you from any network failures.</h3>

<p>I know you might say that it rarely happens to me so why should I care about this. I hear you. It rarely happens to me as well but when it did happen I got really frustrated. Especially, when your CI failed without any reason and you found out that one of your dependencies doesn&#8217;t get downloaded properly.</p>

<h3>CI failure</h3>

<p>This frustrates me the most and it&#8217;s one of the reasons why I started doing this. More than often that my CI failed and it&#8217;s because of dependencies didn&#8217;t get resolved or compiled properly and people just kept running it over and over again. To eliminate this problem and let CI just run the tests save me a lot of pulling my hair time.</p>

<h3>Check out and Go!</h3>

<p>This pattern I have learnt while I was working with ThoughtWorks that it&#8217;s so frustrated when you are joining a project and you spend almost half a day just to get your machine up and running and run the build script to download all the dependencies. I believed that&#8217;s one of the reasons why Chef and Puppet exist. It&#8217;s so easy when you checkout a project from your source control and you can start coding right away or even run all the tests.</p>

<p>I also have this support from my <a href="http://scottmuc.com/" title="Scott Muc">friend</a></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/noppanit">@noppanit</a> I've been a fan of that technique for a long time now.

<p>Srini also pointed out that you shouldn&#8217;t do that for internal project dependencies</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottMuc">@ScottMuc</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/noppanit">@noppanit</a> agree. It's good for external libraries and toolset libraries. Not good for internal project dependencies.

  </p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I know people might argue that it doesn&#8217;t really work for big project because of the size of the repository. That&#8217;s why I mention small to medium project. It works really well with small projects. Another point to mention is that every developer might have different environment for example, Windows VS Linux which node_modules might not work for both environments. I solve that problem by using Vagrant so everybody has the same environment.</p>

    <updated>2015-02-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.noppanit.com/2015</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just want to take a break from writing about technical posts to just talk about myself a little bit. I&#8217;m inspired by Scott Muc&#8217;s <a href="http://scottmuc.com/my-resolutions-for-2015/" title="Scott's 2015 Resolution">post</a> about his 2015 Resolutions. Before getting into 2015 I want to take a step back and review my 2014</p>

<h2>My 2014</h2>

<ul>
<li>I got the opportunity to work in Turkey as part of my consulting job with <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" title="ThougthWorks">ThoughtWorks</a>. I can count Turkey to be my 6th country I have lived and worked in. I used to work and live in Thailand, China, India, United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey.</li>
<li>Learned C#. C# is the first language I learnt at school when Windows Form was a big thing. I loved it but then the web took over and I felt in love with Java instead and never look back. The project in Turkey is C# so I got to relearn that again and I can say that I like it more than Java now. The language is nicer and more functional. I can do more stuff with less code.</li>
<li>Moved to the US.</li>
</ul>


<h2>My 2015</h2>

<h3>Move to the US and join Fusion</h3>

<p>I decided to join <a href="http://fusion.net">Fusion</a> and left my glamorous consulting job. Partly because of the city. I felt in love with New York City when I was there in 2013 for a conference and I thought it would be nice to live here. When the opportunity came I took it immediately. Now two months passed by and I still love the city and my job. Much to explore and lots of places to travel in the US. Fusion is also the first place I get to know what&#8217;s like to work remotely. I absolutely love it. I get to be anywhere and also do what I love which is coding. I will write another post about remote collaboration later. Fusion is a media company which is a new field that I haven&#8217;t explored before.</p>

<h3>Join Kollaboration</h3>

<p>I join <a href="http://www.kollaborationnewyork.org" title="Kollaboration New York">Kollaboration</a> New York as a Technical Director because of my roommate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tannerchung" title="Tanner Chung">Tanner Chung</a>. Kollaboration is a non-profit organization that help and promote Asian American artists through entertainment. In this organization, I get to learn what&#8217;s like to be Asian American. I&#8217;m asian myself but I was born in Asia. So, I didn&#8217;t know the problems a lot of asian people living abroad having.</p>

<h2>What I want to do in 2015</h2>

<h3>Learn to invest</h3>

<p>Who doesn&#8217;t want to have money? I&#8217;m going to learn how to invest my saving and will keep posting the results.</p>

<h3>Travel across America</h3>

<p>When I was living in Europe, you can get to a lot of countries in just 2-3 hours but in America everywhere is so big and South American has always been my dream location.</p>

<h3>Learn Spanish</h3>

<p>My previous goal leads to this goal. I speak Thai, English and Mandarin. I learnt German before but didn&#8217;t really get anywhere. This year I&#8217;m going to learn Spanish and make it my fourth language. I love languages and it&#8217;s fun to talk to the locals and amazed them with their language.</p>

<h3>Run a marathon</h3>

<p>My friend Rajveer and <a href="https://twitter.com/sragu">Srini</a> inspire me to running. I&#8217;m a chubby guy and I really want to get into shape. Running a marathon takes a lot out of you mentally and physically. I thought if I could do it at least for once, I&#8217;d accomplish something.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I started off 2015 pretty good. I went to India for my friend&#8217;s wedding in Rajasthan. I went to US west coast to experience super cold whether. I learned PHP and WordPress and improved my JavaScript skills which I will continue doing that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People say always use event delegation for adding event because it&#8217;s faster. But how fast exactly? I really want to create a test case for this, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to run B<a href="http://benchmarkjs.com/" title="benchmark.js">enchmark.js</a> in browser. So, I thought we could just use Chrome Developer Tool to achieve this.</p>

<h2>What are we measuring?</h2>

<p>As I said in the beginning, we want to know how fast event delegation is compared to direct binding that most people do. For example, I&#8217;ve always seen people do this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#ul li&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;click&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// doing something amazing.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What is actually doing is, jQuery will add the event to each of the <strong>li</strong> in the DOM. If you have 3-4 lis, then I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to make a big difference. However, if you have a thousand lis, you will see some difference. I&#8217;ll show you by using Chrome Developer Tool.</p>

<h2>What do we need?</h2>

<p>We need some basic HTML</p>

<p>It&#8217;s going to be something like this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;ul</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;parent&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  // 999 more <span class="nt">&lt;li&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then we will have JavaScript like this</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#parent li&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;click&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;you clicked me!&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you open your html page on Chrome you should see something like this.<br/>
<img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-21-at-7.06.19-PM.png"></p>

<p>If you go down to where JavaScript is executed You will see it takes around <strong>37ms</strong> to execute the snippet.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-21-at-7.07.18-PM.png"></p>

<p>Now change your snippet to be event delegation</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#parent&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;click&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;li&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;you clicked me!&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And refresh the page you should see something like this.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-21-at-7.12.02-PM.png"></p>

<p>Now it will only take <strong>2ms</strong> to execute the snippet. It&#8217;s because the event is added to one element not 1000 of them.</p>

<p>This is just an easy example that you can do it yourself to improve your performance.</p>

    <link href="http://www.noppanit.com/create-simple-vagrant-plugin/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.noppanit.com/create-simple-vagrant-plugin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been searching all over the Internet to find how to create a vagrant plugin. <a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/index.html" title="vagrant plugin">Vagrant homepage</a> has information on how to create a vagrant plugin, but I would like to give a real world example. The plugin I&#8217;m going to create is <strong><a href="https://github.com/noppanit/vagrant-ls" title="vagrant-ls">vagrant-ls</a></strong> which is inspired by <strong><a href="https://github.com/joshmcarthur/vagrant-list" title="vagrant-list">vagrant-list</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>How do you start</h2>

<p>Vagrant that you installed already won&#8217;t work with local developing plugin. So, I recommend you to create a new gemset for your plugin. If you haven&#8217;t used <a href="http://rvm.io/" title="rvm">RVM</a>, I highly recommend you use it now. It&#8217;s awesome!.</p>

<p>Once you have RVM installed you can create a gemset using this command <strong>rvm gemset create vagrant-ls</strong>. Then <strong>rvm gemset use vagrant-ls</strong> (Just in case). I recommend you do this for each of your ruby project. It helps you separate your gems, and it won&#8217;t mess up with different versions of your gems. First thing that you have to install is Bundler <strong>gem install bundler</strong>. It&#8217;s because we will use Bundler to manage all of our dependencies. Then you can create <strong>Gemfile</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the most basic you would need for your plugin development. If you wonder what is <em>group :plugins</em>
. <a href="https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/plugins/development-basics.html">Vagrant plugin</a> has already explained that. This will load your local plugin automatically without doing <em>bundle exec vagrant install plugin vagrant-ls</em> which will not quite work anyway.</p>

<p>Then you can create your gemspec file. I name it <strong>vagrant-ls.gemspec</strong></p>

<p>Then you crate <strong>Rakefile</strong></p>

<p>I almost forget you need to create VERSION file for gemspec to get your version number</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>I just run <strong>VBoxManage</strong> command to list all of the vms. Once you are done, you are ready to test your plugin.</p>

<p>You can run this command</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>vagrant ls
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>. If everything is correct, it should list all of your vms with the name of your vms, so you know where you are you running all those vms.</p>

<h2>Publish your gem</h2>

<p>Now, it&#8217;s time to spread the love of your gem. You need to build your gem first. Remember the Rakefile? You can just run <em>rake build</em></p>

<p>It will pack your gem to <strong>.pkg</strong> folder. Then you can just run</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'>gem push pkg/vagrant-ls-0.0.1.gem
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>. That&#8217;s it you have your gem published. If you look for <a href="http://guides.rubygems.org/publishing/">documentation</a> for publishing your gem.</p>

<p>You can find my repository <a href="https://github.com/noppanit/vagrant-ls">here</a>. The reason I create this post is that, the plugin might evolve but this blog stays and it will be a good starting point for other people.</p>

<p>I think they might have got hundred of tweets a day. So they might have slipped. The first when I read this I quickly scrolled up to see if I got a typo. But they&#8217;re right though I chose T-Mobile. Just a little laugh for me today.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This rarely happens and you would be surprised what is the cause of this. Recently, I have just finished a mobile site using knockout.js. I have used a fair amount of Virtual Elements in Knockout.js. But weirdly enough one day my Manager came in and talk to my <a href="https://twitter.com/sragu" title="Srini">tech lead</a> (@sragu) that the site is not working. We quickly checked with our live site and everything was ok yet the site from his phone wasn&#8217;t working at all.</p>

<p>We spent quite a long time to find out the cause of this. We cleared the cache. We restarted the phone. Tried different browsers. Luckily, then we found out this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4113268/how-to-stop-javascript-injection-from-vodafone-proxy">thread</a> from Stackoverflow.com.</p>

<p>The cause of this is that Vodafone corporate network stripped out HTML comments to save and optimise the bandwidth.</p>

<p>The solution is to set Cache-Control to no-transform and the problem solved. If you have the same problem as me then this is the solution.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Love flea market? Love antiques? And you are in Istanbul, you should try out this place if you like antique stuff and what to kill a couple hours on a Sunday in Istanbul. The market opens every Sunday. I don&#8217;t know what time but I was there from 12pm &#8211; 3pm. I don&#8217;t really know how to get there by public transportation, but you can get a taxi to there from Şişli Metro station. It&#8217;s only a couple minutes away by taxi.</p>

    <id>http://www.noppanit.com/alright-charge-phone-shavers-outlet</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/ShaverSocketUK.jpg/170px-ShaverSocketUK.jpg" title="Shavers only outlet" ></p>

<p>I believe everyone has the same problem once in a while or often that you forget your phone charger. Or even you didn&#8217;t forget your phone charger if you travel between UK and Europe you might forget the converter or adapter. If you stay in a hotel you must have seen one of those Shaver-only outlets. You would think that it&#8217;s clearly said that it&#8217;s for shaver only. So, I cannot use it for anything else. One day, I travel from Europe to the UK and the socket is different. Europe has one of those two-prong socket, and in the UK they use the big three-leg socket.</p>

<p>Then what can you do? I did some research on some myths. I have also tried it myself. It&#8217;s ok to charge your phone with those sockets.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Modern adapter if you flip it up and have a look you will see this sign or similar to this. &#8220;Travel adapter 110V &#8211; 240V&#8221; What this means is that this adapter will transform the current range from 110 &#8211; 220V to be usable for your appliance. There&#8217;s a reference <a href="http://blog.fosketts.net/2013/02/03/shavers-electrical-outlet/">here</a>. However, those outlets are not suitable for charging your big electronic equipments such as laptop or blow dryer. Once in a while it should be ok to use the outlet to charge your phone. Especially, if you travel from Europe you must have the two-prong socket adapter which is suitable for the outlet.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Normally, you would name your test class like this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>   <span class="c1">//some awesome test code here!</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&#8217;s two reasons why I would do this. First, to let IntelliJ find the test class easily and it&#8217;s easy to spot the test class when you scroll through.</p>

<p>However, lately inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/JeroenSoeters" title="Jeroen">@JeroenSoeters</a> my colleague which I don&#8217;t know where he got this from. I started naming test class like this.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">Product</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="c1">//some awesome code here!</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">When_building_a_product</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>   <span class="c1">//some awesome test code here!</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="n">When_building_a_product_with_some_more_data</span> <span class="o">{</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There&#8217;s one reason to do this I can think of. You can clearly see the purpose of this class and you can have multiple test classes or <strong>Product</strong> instead of having all the tests in one class and everything is cluttered so you have to scroll up and down</p>

<p>Not everybody likes this convention. I hate it at first but I&#8217;m starting to use it more often and I like it. What do you guys think?</p>
