title: "So You Want to Climb Mount Rainier"
---

This blog is a really long over-due since I summited Mt. Rainer last year. It’s the first mountain I ever climbed and probably not the last. I chose to climb with [AlphineAscents](https://www.alpineascents.com/) which I booked 9 months in advance with my friend Lakshmi. AlpineAscents is very professional and knowledgeable about the routes and safety.

## What to expect
Prepare physically and mentally. The hardest day would be the day you summit. You will have to wake up around midnight to reach the top before sunrise and come back down before sunset. It takes about 5 hours from the base camp to reach the summit. I did it in summer so the temperature wasn't too cold but it's still really cold with the wind. Not only you have to train for the hike but you also have to prepare your mind as well.


### The views
I won’t write a lot here. I’m just going to show off my pictures.

## How can you be prepared
It goes without saying that fitness is really important. Me and my friend trained by putting a 50-pound bag on our backs and just kept walking for 4 hours. This to simulate the walk that we would endure each day. The plan was to walk at least 5-6 hours everyday until the summit day. 

To me, I think the one most important thing is your mind. You have to just be prepare in your head that you want to summit this climb. On my summit day, as we keep ascending the mountain, every part of my body kept screaming stop and in my head I just kept hearing the sound of my other self shouting "why are you doing this” or “wouldn’t it be better if you just quit right now and start descending while you can”. I quickly shifted my focus to my breathing and steps instead, it helped me to take my mind of the pain and cold. At which point, it becomes automatic that you have to keep breaking and keep going up. 

### Water
Water is really important. The hike was really physically hard on your body. If you hike or camp a lot, you must have heard the term “If you feel thirsty, it’s already too late”. So you have to really keep hydrating. You won’t have enough water from what you carry for sure so keep putting snow in your bottle. If you’re dehydrating, you will get cramps. I got my cramps on the first day and It was not fun trying to keep up with your fellow hikers and 55 pounds on your back with muscle pains. So, keep chucking that bottle of water.  

### Boots
Your boots are your best friend during the hike. I decided to rent the boots and I think it was a mistake on my part since I didn’t have time to get to know the boots and I ended up with big blisters on ankles. It wasn’t fun hiking 14,000 ft with blisters and bruises. I would highly recommend if you can to get your own boots or at least try walking in them before you rent the boots. REI is a place to start as they have 100% guarantee return if you don’t like or want to 

### Energy
Climbing a mountain takes a lot of energy and you have a limited supply of food. I would say bring more candies or chocolate or energy gel to keep you going the least amount of weight. Nuts are also a good options. I would say this is not the time where you worry about your weight so anything in front of you you just have to eat it.
