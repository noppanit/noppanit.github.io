    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="should-you-pay-in-local-or-home-currency-while-travelling">Should you pay in local or home currency while travelling?</h2>
<p>Short answer. Pay in local currency. For example, I have a credit card from the US and I’m going to be in Hong Kong for my vacation. I should pay in Hong Kong dollar.</p>

<p>Long answer. There’s something about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_currency_conversion">DCC</a> that you have to pay a small fee for the customer to see the amount in home currency in the receipt. Here’s an example.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/credit-card-receipt.jpg" width="250" height="250" title="‘Credit card receipt’" ></p>

<p>If I had paid in US dollar, I would have paid \$0.81 more. It doesn’t seem like a lot but it definitely adds up. I checked my credit card transaction and it showed \$19.33. It’s also good if you can get the card that doesn’t charge foreign transaction fee.</p>
