    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So silly of me I have just &#8220;accidentally&#8221; deleted my home directory T_T. There is a way to help that by override rm command to move file to .Trash.</p>

<p>Just copy this code to ~/.bash_profile and restart your terminal.</p>

<pre><code>function rm () {
  local path
  for path in "$@"; do
    # ignore any arguments
    if [[ "$path" = -* ]]; then :
    else
      local dst=${path##*/}
      # append the time if necessary
      while [ -e ~/.Trash/"$dst" ]; do
        dst="$dst "$(date +%H-%M-%S)
      done
      mv "$path" ~/.Trash/"$dst"
    fi
  done
}
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have just finished my Unix exam. I know somebody hates VI very much, because it is very hard to use. It is so command-line, something like that. But learning to use this editor is very useful because you never know when will you unable to use X-Window or when will you face with command-line configuration.</p>

<p>So, just easing you in. VI is an editor in Unix and Unix-like system. It is command-line-based and very easy to use. You can learn its basics in just 10 minutes. VI has two modes; command mode and insert mode. Command mode is where you put your command and insert mode is where you put your text. Easy!</p>

<h2>How to switch between two modes</h2>

<ol>
<li>In VI editor, press ESC to switch command mode, and press ESC again to insert mode. If you&#8217;re not sure, always press ESC two times, it will always be command mode. You will hear the beep sound.</li>
</ol>


<h2>How to insert text</h2>

<ol>
<li>In VI editor, press ESC two times to command mode, and press &#8220;i&#8221; or &#8220;a&#8221; and then type your text. &#8220;i&#8221; is insert, &#8220;a&#8221; is append your text</li>
</ol>


<h2>How to delete your text</h2>

<ol>
<li>In VI editor, press ESC two times to command mode, and where the cursor is press &#8220;x&#8221; to delete the character you want.</li>
</ol>


<h2>How to navigate in VI</h2>

<ol>
<li>In VI editor, you cannot use arrow keys in your keyboard to up, down, left or right. So how?, In VI editor, press ESC two times to command mode, and press &#8220;h&#8221; to navigate left, &#8220;j&#8221; to go down, &#8220;k&#8221; to go up and &#8220;l&#8221; to go left.</li>
</ol>


<h2>How to save and exit in VI</h2>

<ol>
<li>In VI editor, press ESC two times to command mode and then press &#8220;:wq&#8221; to save and exit the program.</li>
</ol>


<p>See how easy is that, but VI is more than this you can read its documentation or visit <a href="http://www.eng.hawaii.edu/Tutor/vi.html">this</a></p>
