    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>

<p>I’m no expert in this field nor having a PhD in Compiler. This is just my pure curiosity and I hope to share of what I’ve discovered so people can continue their curiosity.</p>

<h2 id="why-im-interested-in-this">Why I’m interested in this.</h2>
<p>I was asked once during my technical interview, “What happen when you execute fs.readFileSync(‘’)”. What he meant was that how JavaScript code interacts with the machine under the hood. At the time, I thought I just wrote that code and there you go I got the content of the file.</p>

<p>I couldn’t answer and I didn’t get the job. I just recently became a JavaScript developer because of my interest in front-end and back-end in the same time. Knowing JavaScript allows me to get the best of both worlds. However, the only thing I know about JavaScript is that it’s something to do with V8 and I had no idea what’s going on under the hood. So, I took the time to really understand how JavaScript works and the history behind it. So, I started with the task a computer does best; executing commands or how does a computer execute a command.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-computer-works">How does computer works?</h2>
<p>One of the best movies for me is “The Core” where “Rat” had to hack the Internet to control the flow of information. The hacker claims that he only knew one language, “zeros and ones”. At the time, I understood that it’s something to do with binary number, and I thought that it’s just hollywood talk and these people didn’t know what they were talking. I have to write <code>print('Hello');</code> to print <code>Hello</code> on my console, it has nothing to do with zeros or ones.</p>

<p>So, I started digging and I found <a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1pv40y/for_those_of_you_wondering_how_code_becomes_ones/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, when we execute a piece of code, the compiler compiles the code to a set of instructions which is Assembly. Then, we have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language#Assembler">assembler</a> to translate the instructions to their numerical equivalents. For example,</p>

<p><code>bash
ADD esp, 8
</code></p>

<p>is translated in x86 architecture like this.</p>

<p>``` bash
Raw Hex (zero bytes in bold):</p>

<p>83C408</p>

<p>String Literal:</p>

<p>“\x83\xC4\x08”</p>

<p>Array Literal:</p>

<p>{ 0x83, 0xC4, 0x08 }</p>

<p>Disassembly:
0:  83 c4 08                add    esp,0x8</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Notice the HEX code <code>83C408</code> which you can translate to binary number later for the computer to understand.</p>

<p>You can use this <a href="https://defuse.ca/online-x86-assembler.htm">online assembler</a> to play with it.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-javascript-engine-v8-work">How does JavaScript engine (v8) work?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, V8 <a href="http://thibaultlaurens.github.io/javascript/2013/04/29/how-the-v8-engine-works/">translates JavaScript</a>
code to machine code with <em>JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler</em>.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://www.mattzeunert.com/2015/08/19/viewing-assembly-code-generated-by-v8.html">four main stages</a> of how the code passes through V8.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>JavaScript - Your code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hydrogen - Intermediate code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lithium - Machine specific code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Machine Code - This is what your computer understand.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In this post we’re going to see the assembly code which is the machine specific code.</p>

<h2 id="show-me-the-code">Show me the code</h2>
<p>Enough talking. Now show me the code you say. Let’s say you have a simple function to add two numbers together like this.</p>

<p><code>javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
</code></p>

<p>To view the machine code in Assembly you need to install V8. First you need to install <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools">depot-tools</a>. Once you install <code>depot-tools</code> you can run
Follow this <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Using%20Git">instruction</a>.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: The documentation of how to install V8 is subject to change. So, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Building%20with%20GN">link</a>.</p>

<p>In order to get <code>V8</code> you need to run. You will also need <code>Python 2</code></p>

<p><code>bash
fetch v8
cd v8
</code></p>

<p>The script will take sometime to finish. It will fetch V8 source code. Then you need to build all the dependencies by running.</p>

<p><code>bash
gclient sync
</code></p>

<p>Now you need to install D8. The next step is going to take a long time. So, get yourself a nice cup of coffee.</p>

<p><code>bash
make x64.release objectprint=on disassembler=on
</code></p>

<p>Once everything is in place, you’re ready to see how your code is communicating with your CPU.</p>

<p>You can do this to get the assembly code</p>

<p><code>bash
cd out/x64.release
./d8 --print-code ~/Downloads/add.js
</code></p>

<p>This is what you’re likely going to see.</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>~~Now, in theory you can grab the hex code and run that in C and you should be able to get the same result. I haven’t tried it please let me know if it works or not.~~ It wouldn’t work because the generated code has fixed memory address from when the program was executed.</p>

<p>What I learn from this post is how is my JavaScript code executed in my computer and the next time I got asked, I will be able to answer that interview question. Sometimes, it’s nicer to be asked a question like this than how to revert a binary tree on a whiteboard. Don’t you think?</p>
