    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="should-you-pay-in-local-or-home-currency-while-travelling">Should you pay in local or home currency while travelling?</h2>
<p>Short answer. Pay in local currency. For example, I have a credit card from the US and I’m going to be in Hong Kong for my vacation. I should pay in Hong Kong dollar.</p>

<p>Long answer. There’s something about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_currency_conversion">DCC</a> that you have to pay a small fee for the customer to see the amount in home currency in the receipt. Here’s an example.</p>

<p>{% img /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/credit-card-receipt.jpg 250 250 ‘Credit card receipt’ %}</p>

<p>If I had paid in US dollar, I would have paid \$0.81 more. It doesn’t seem like a lot but it definitely adds up. I checked my credit card transaction and it showed \$19.33. It’s also good if you can get the card that doesn’t charge foreign transaction fee.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="what-is-this-item">What is this item?</h2>
<p>Short answer is. A pocket Wifi. Or some sort of a way for you to have Internet at your finger tip.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-article">Why this article?</h2>
<p>I don’t usually write anything when I’m travelling, but I think this is quiet a different experience I have from other countries I have been to.</p>

<p>I have been to more than 30 countries and I did not experience language barrier as much as I experienced in Japan. Granted, I speak Mandarin so I don’t have a problem in China. I got by easily even in Russia and country like Turkey.</p>

<p>If you’re one of those want-to-unplug travellers, then this article is not for you. If I go hiking, usually I would not care about connectedness. I want to just go out and experience the nature. But for this trip, I visited mostly big cities and I wanted to get as much information I need especially Tokyo.</p>

<p>Japan has one of the most complex train systems in the world. In Tokyo, you have two companies for Subway and multiple train operators. City Mapper helps a lot with the subways but it still lacks information about other train systems to get you to other parts of the city. Uber and Taxi in Toyko are very expensive in my opinion. I used Google Maps all the time and it saved me time and money.</p>

<p>Subway stations in Tokyo is enormous if you get off wrong exit you might have to walk at least 10-15 minutes to get to your destination. Google Maps has very clear indication of where to exit closest to your destination.</p>

<p>I used Google Translate to communicate with one shop assistant because we wanted to get our shoes fixed and he didn’t speak a single English word. So, we handed the phone for him to speak and Google Translate to translate to English for us. It helped tremendously!</p>

<p>If your phone operator has affordable roaming option like T-Mobile in the US then you’re all set.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-one-of-those-pocket-wifis">How to get one of those Pocket Wifis</h2>
<p>I researched quite a bit and I chose this <a href="http://www.globaladvancedcomm.com/">http://www.globaladvancedcomm.com/</a>. It’s really easy.</p>

<p>I ordered online two days before my departure and it only costed me $140 for the whole 15 days in Japan. I shared the wifi with 2 other friends. You can choose for them to deliver the wifi to your hotel. When I arrived to the hotel it was waiting for me at the reception.</p>

<p>This is what you get in the envelop.</p>

<p>{% img /wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Wifi.jpeg 300px What you get in the envelop %}</p>

<p>This is the return envelop that you need to drop in a mailbox</p>

<p>{% img /wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Envelop.jpeg 300px Envelop %}</p>

<p>Mailbox at Haneda airport to return the wifi.</p>

<p>{% img /wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Mailbox.jpeg 300px Mailbox %}</p>

<p>During the whole trip, there wasn’t even one occasion where the wifi didn’t work. I got the connection the whole time and the battery lasted for at least from 9am to 7pm. If you have a power bank it can easily last until the end of the day. If you have more devices, I believe you will need to choose the premium one with faster speed.</p>

    <updated>2015-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.noppanit.com/what-should-you-expect-for-salkantay-trek-to-machu-picchu</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m not really a travel blogger but I’ll try to share my experience as much as possible. I’ve just come back from Peru (Machu Picchu). Me and a bunch of my friends did the Salkantay trek which hike from Cusco (sort of) to Machu Picchu. It’s a 5 days 4 nights trip. The hike is really challenging physically and mentally. You will experience altitude sickness and soreness from your body. Funny thing is I didn’t feel a thing at the highest peak, some of my friends experienced different symptoms. One of the best I’ve heard is; “It’s like EDM concert banging in my head”.</p>

<h2 id="stay-warm">Stay warm</h2>

<p>You really need to dress warm because you will be walking at the altitude around 14,000 feet which is going to be quite cold. I’d suggest a lot of layers instead of big puffy jacket. Base layer is really important and a good fleece. One thing that you can’t miss out is a good pair of wool socks.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-for-the-rain">Prepare for the rain</h2>

<p>It’s going to rain. What you really need is a good rain jacket and or Pancho is you want. I find rain jacket is enough to keep you dry. However, what really important is waterproof hiking shoes or you need extra pairs of socks. If you have your camera, rain cover for your bag and camera are really crucial.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-for-the-altitude">Prepare for the altitude</h2>

<p>If you think you will be affected by the altitude, please consult with your doctor to get some pills. I didn’t really get any headache while hiking on the high altitude but everybody is different.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-don8217t-really-need">What you don’t really need</h2>

<p>Water is what you really need. But you can get water at every stop along the trail. What you don’t really need is water purification. However, it’s just a small pack if you don’t mind carrying that.</p>

<h2 id="pack-light">Pack light</h2>

<p>I found myself overpack for the hike and I exhausted myself on the third day. If you think you’re going to need snacks. I suggest having <a href="http://www.starburst.com/">starburst</a>. My friend gave away two starbursts at every stop point which I think they really keep me going in terms of energy. I had my raw almonds and dry berries which helped a lot.</p>

<h2 id="sleep-comfy">Sleep comfy</h2>

<p>Sleeping bag is a must. However, I had a really good night sleep with my <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/866771/sea-to-summit-aeros-pillow-premium">camping pillow</a> and it’s inflatable and really light.</p>

<h2 id="taking-pictures-of-the-locals">Taking pictures of the locals</h2>

<p>If you walk around in Cusco, you might find local people dressing in traditional custom. If you take a picture of them, they might ask you for some money. I gave them 1 soles and it was enough. And make sure you ask their permission before you take a picture of them.</p>

<h2 id="coca-leaves">Coca leaves</h2>

<p>The locals told us to chew coca leaves to prevent the tiredness and altitude sickness. To be honest, they didn’t help much but I really like the coca tea in the morning.</p>

<h2 id="local-food">Local food</h2>

<p>Peruvian cuisine is really interesting or at least from my point of view. I had Guinea pig and Alpaca. I like Alpaca but the Guinea pig is not really my jam. At least I tried.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re in Moscow and you want somewhere to just sit down and catch up with some stuff. Or you just want to have a place to read. I recommend <a href="http://pushkin.ziferblat.net/en/" title="Ziferblat">Ziferblat</a>, it’s pay-per-minute cafe in Central Moscow.</p>

<p>Just 5-min walk from Tverskaya Station (Тверская). Then look for this sign.</p>

<p>{% img https://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-18-at-22.52.43.png %}</p>

<p>You have to ring the bell and the security guard will buzz you in then you have to walk upstairs (2nd floor). Unfortunately, at least when I was there people speak little English but understandable. Also, the people are really friendly over there. You just need to tell your name and pay at the end when you’re ready to rome Moscow again.</p>

    <updated>2014-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>https://www.noppanit.com/bouldering-gym-kadikoy-istanbul</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I would like to just contribute more to the bouldering in Istanbul. Since, I have been in Istanbul for over a month and I like bouldering. However, after a bit of searching I found little information about bouldering gyms in Istanbul. So far, I have been to two gyms and I’d like to share one of them first.</p>

<p>It’s called <a href="http://www.boulderistanbul.com/" title="boulder istanbul">Boulder Istanbul</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How to get there</strong><br />
This one is quite easy to get to and the location on the map below is quite accurate. I have checked in myself.</p>

<p>You can get the metro to Kadıköy and then walk from there for only 10-15 minutes or you can get the metrobus to Söğütlüçeşme which is the terminal station at the Asian side and then walk for 15-20 minutes. It’s quite a nice walk through kebab shops.</p>

<p><strong>Some pics</strong></p>

<p>{% img https://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/20140302_141636.jpg %}</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong><br />
It’s only 15 TL for a day pass.</p>

<p><strong>Official address</strong><br />
<span class="adr"><br /> <span class="street-address">Nüzhetefendi Sokak No:54 (Rıhtım caddesinin 3 üst paraleli)</span><br /> <span class="locality">Kadıköy</span>&lt;/br&gt;<br /> <span class="region">Istanbul</span><br /> </span></p>
