          <p>I don’t know if you’ve ever seen or had this before, but it happened to me once. I woke up one they, just wanted to look at my status and how my friends were doing. I open http://www.facebook.com and I realised that I couldn’t log in to my Facebook account. WTF! Then I did everything I could, go to Facebook Help, Reset Password, googled lots of blogs. Then I gave up, I ended up creating a new Facebook account and found out that lots of people on the Internet had the same problems as I had. I tried emailing Facebook Help Centre as well and got some replies but nothing was helpful. Also, it was like seven months ago.</p>

<p>What I did was just beek reporting the other account, like Inappropriate profile picture, or this account pretends to be me. And then today, my other Facebook account has been deleted already. I’m happy!.</p>
