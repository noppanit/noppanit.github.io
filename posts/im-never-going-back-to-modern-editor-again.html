          <p>Ok, the title might be a little bit exaggerating. But let me clear this up first. I still use modern editors, TextMate, Atom.io or IntelliJ. They are pros and cons. But here’s my real answer if people ask me. I want to be the cool kid!.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>I don’t know if you’re like me but I get asked almost all the time I go to a meetup or conference, “What’s your favourite editor”?. People almost always say Vim</td>
      <td>Emacs. I tried both of them in the past and gave up more than I can remember because of all the shortcuts and plugins and I just get too frustrated to use either of them. Finally, I have made a decision that I’m going to stick with Vim for a month and let’s see if at the end of the month I still can’t use it. It’s been almost a month and I’d say I’m never going back to modern editors again (at least when I’m coding scripting languages). Here’s why.</td>

<h3 id="its-just-easier">It’s just easier</h3>

<p>I know it’s not really easier than TextMate or Sublime. You still have to learn a lot of shortcuts and commands. Also, bare-bone Vim just doesn’t have when you get in TextMate or Sublime (e.g, Find file, Command+T, Directory structure or code completion). However, after you powered through that learning phrase everything is just natural to you.</p>

<p>If you want to clear any trailing whitespaces you just have to type <strong>%s/\s+$//</strong> and hit enter. If you want to run some external command you can always do in Vim. For example, if you just want to <strong>git status</strong> you can install <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">Git wrapper</a> or you can just run <strong>:!git status</strong>. You don’t even need to go to your terminal which I think it’s faster.</p>

<p>If you’re a good engineer, you will always do TDD. Going back and fourth between the editor and terminal, it’s just too annoying. I remember when I was coding Java I can just hit Cmd+t in IntelliJ or .NET and you see green bars. Isn’t it just awesome? I realised that TextMate and Sublime have plugins to do that as well or you can just write your own plugin or package. I tried a couple of plugins and they never work for me. In Vim, it just works!.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>If Vim</td>
      <td>Emacs doesn’t do what you want, you will almost always find the plugin that does it for you. Currently, my standard plugins are. <strong>NERDTree</strong>, <strong>CommandT</strong>, <strong>vim-fugitive</strong>, <strong>vim-rooter</strong>, <strong>vim-virtualenv</strong>. All these plugins just make my Vim functions the same as Atom.io or Sublime.</td>
    </tr>

<h3 id="not-for-everyone">Not for everyone</h3>

<p>I have to admit that the first few weeks I got really frustrated. I almost banged my keyboard against the monitor. I found myself opening Atom.io every time I couldn’t do some basic editing in Vim. For example, using <strong>vimgrep</strong> wasn’t what I expected and I ended up googling a lot. Now I get the hang of it and I don’t use Atom anymore. The worst case is I will just use command line instead.</p>
