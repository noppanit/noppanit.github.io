          <p>I have to admit that I accidently dropped my camera into the river while I was on a trip with my friends. But after I dropped my camera into the river, I suddenly took out the batteries and the grip and CF card. Afterwards, I sit the camera in a camera bag with a silicon bag for a day. Everything worked like a charm. However, after two weeks I came to the UK to study and all of a sudden the bloody error 99 shown.</p>

<p>I google and have a camera checked with an expert. They told me that “you have to turn the camera to Canon to change the shutter and a main circuit board. But my can shoot the picture as nothing with my camera except that the error 99 occur when I turn on the camera.</p>

<p>Here how I solve my problem and I used my camera ever since without problem. Because if I have to send the camera away, it’s very costly.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Before turn on the camera press the JUMP button and hold and then turn on the camera. The error 99 disappeared. At least it works for me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take out the battery, the grip, the CF card, and leave for 20 mins. Insert the battery with only fully charged. And see if it can solve your error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to clean the contact len with a pencil rubber, carefully clean the surface with the camera down, so the bits don’t get in to the camera.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to change the CF card.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You should try. But if you still have a warranty, just send the camera to Canon and change everything they said.</p>

<p>Good luck!!!</p>
