  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is just another application that choose to implement in nodejs, because it&#8217;s easy and very useful to use. What do you usually do when you need to learn a new language? You have to remember as many as vocabularies right? Here&#8217;s what I used to do when I was learning Chinese. Have a deck of story cards and wrote down vocabulary on one side and meaning on the other side.</p>

<p>My application <a href="https://github.com/noppanit/my-flash-card" title="MY Flash Card">https://github.com/noppanit/my-flash-card</a> is to demonstrate how easy it is to write an application in NodeJs with a touch of CSS3 to make it elegant.</p>

<p>My first version is using json as a mean of database, but the next version I&#8217;m going to use RedisToGo because I&#8217;m hosting this application on heroku.</p>

<time class='entry-date' datetime='2012-04-01T00:00:00-04:00'><span class='date'><span class='date-month'>Apr</span> <span class='date-day'>1</span><span class='date-suffix'>st</span>, <span class='date-year'>2012</span></span> <span class='time'>12:00 am</span></time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People would think why would you want to do that. Well, in my case I just want to use haml to generate html for me in Test so that I could inject that in to Pusher to test the functionality of the feed page. I could use static html string, but if I change haml I don&#8217;t want to come back to the test and change the string again.</p>

<p>So, Haml actually is just a static class that you can call anywhere, but where you call inside Sinatra or Rails controller. You could just use</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>haml :my_view</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However, if you do this outside Sinatra, you would get an exception that haml is not found or something close.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s just a simple solution plus I&#8217;ve added how to call helper in that as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The new iPad is coming out and everybody is very excited about that, even myself but I&#8217;ve got my iPad2 already which I can&#8217;t really afford a new one. BTW, that&#8217;s not the point about this post. Before I got my iPad and I was researching extensively which one to get 3G or wifi. I found some article suggesting that people should just get the wifi one, it&#8217;s not worth getting the 3G one because you can hardly use it, because right now you could find free wifi hotspots just about everywhere and every hotel or building provides free wifi as well. However, here&#8217;s my point why you should get the 3G one.</p>

<p>&#8211; The sim card is quite cheap now to get the 500MB. I use <a href="http://giffgaff.com/" title="Giffgaff">giffgaff</a> and it works just fine.<br/>
&#8211; Even though you get a free wifi just about everywhere, what about the place where you might want to use it? or even on the train? and you don&#8217;t want to pay a ludicrous fee.<br/>
&#8211; Even though you get a free wifi just about everywhere, sometimes it&#8217;s just not good enough. I&#8217;m a regular traveller, and sometimes I have to stay outside of wifi coverage. Having 3G access really saves my life a couple times, by helping me booking some tickets or replying some emails. Or stop me from getting bored waiting for transportation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Not sure if this only happens to me. But just sometimes heroku just give out &#8220;Application Error&#8221; for no reason on my application. No errors have been logged in the console. So I send a couple email to herouk support but no luck, because there&#8217;s no log. So, I digged further. I found out that using http session on cloud might be a problem, because you don&#8217;t know where you application server will be or will it be scaled somewhere else. So, sometime the session is cut (It just my theory without any reference). So, please let me know if I&#8217;m wrong.</p>

<p>This is how I solved the problem, I changed everything and used memcache instead and the problem is gone. Memcache is in-memeory cache system which you have store objects as well. And I&#8217;m sure that it&#8217;s scaleable. So, if you have the same problem as me I would suggest using memcache instead it&#8217;s easy.</p>

<p>Ps. I use Sinatra.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is not to provide a tutorial of how to combine those three awesome applications together, but it might stop you from scratching your head when the test cannot be run correctly.</p>

<ol>
<li>You need to have Sinatra in subclass style rather than classic style. <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Using%20a%20Classic%20Style%20Application%20with%20a%20config.ru" title="Sinatra subclass">Sinatra subclass-style</a></li>
<li>This is quite importance, you might find some website that is using Spec. but you need to change it to be &#8220;RSpec&#8221; in order for it to work.</li>

I woke up one they, just wanted to look at my status and how my friends were doing. I open <a href="http://www.facebook.com">http://www.facebook.com</a> and I realised that I couldn&#8217;t log in to my Facebook account. WTF! Then I did everything I could, go to Facebook Help, Reset Password, googled lots of blogs. Then I gave up, I ended up creating a new Facebook account and found out that lots of people on the Internet had the same problems as I had. I tried emailing Facebook Help Centre as well and got some replies but nothing was helpful. Also, it was like seven months ago.</p>

<p>What I did was just beek reporting the other account, like Inappropriate profile picture, or this account pretends to be me. And then today, my other Facebook account has been deleted already. I&#8217;m happy!.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week I helped out my friends <a href="http://www.eewei.com" title="Eewei">Eewei</a> and <a href="http://www.fab.co.uk">Jill</a> in <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/london-2011/">Future of web app conference</a> in London. Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t be in the conference. They presented this really amazing called <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a></p>

<p>So, you&#8217;re allowed to transform a simple html website to be operational in modern mobile devies, such as iPhone, BB or Android phones. What you need to do it just add a javascript file and a css file from jQueryMobile site and that&#8217;s it. Bam! you have a ready to go mobile website in a min. Interesting to point out is that it&#8217;s still in a development stage and the latest release when I&#8217;m writing this is just a RC1. So, if you try it now you might be getting some bugs or some unresponsive actions when clicking buttons. Also, when you include the javascript src file and the css version, the version of the two files need to be corresponded, otherwise it might not be working correctly.</p>

<p>You can say that these days more and more people are browsing websites from mobile devices. Also, it can be said that IE6 has been holding our back on development of javascript or css on desktop for years now (You might have to include a number of different versions of CSS files for different browsers). Whilst on mobile devices IE doesn&#8217;t have any effects on development. Furthermore, developing native apps for just iPhone or Android might be a daunting task for most people who don&#8217;t have any background on Objective-C. Therefore, I think HTML5 for mobile devices might be a better idea to go than starting to build a native app these days.</p>

<p>I have also built a simple webapp from Rails3 and jQuery Mobile deployed on Heroku. If anybody&#8217;s interested. <a href="https://github.com/noppanit/jquery-mobile-example">https://github.com/noppanit/jquery-mobile-example</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I had a chance to involve in Design Jam from my colleague <a href="http://www.eewei.com/">Eewei</a> from Thoughtworks. The idea of this event is to get together with the team in every role (Dev, PM, QA, or as many roles as you could find in your team) to gather ideas as much as possible to solve a problem in design. After you&#8217;ve given a problem to solve, you will be divided into teams and work out the a possible solution to your problem.</p>

<p>The problem that we were trying to solve was</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Going to the cinema used to be a fun social event for people of all ages. Today consumers prefer to watch movies on their phones, laptops and home cinema systems. How do we make the cinema experience at your local theatre more engaging and attractive? Create a mobile app that will get consumers going to the cinema again.&#8221; </strong></p>

<p>Your team will have to think how to design a mobile app for a young busy professional woman who also has just started to date someone. The rules of this game, would be &#8220;no rules&#8221; you can think of anything you could possibly think of.</p>

<p>We had some templates that we need to fill in, such as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rules</li>
<li>Team 1 in action</li>
<li>Team 2 in action</li>
<li>Empathy mapping &#8211; Who will use it? This helps understand what the users motivations are</li>
<li>Elevator pitch &#8211; sum up what your app d</li>
<li>Features &#8211; what is the min and max delightful set?</li>
<li>User journeys &#8211; what is the happy path?</li>
<li>Paper protoypes of the killer apps!</li>
<li>Presentations &#8211; sell it to the dragons den in one sentence!</li>
<li>Feedback/Retro! fyi, sad feedback was that they wanted more time and to develop the app. I see that as positive!</li>
</ul>


<p>My surprises would be I&#8217;ve neven thought we&#8217;d come up with all these ideas in 1.30 hr. And you could get as much as ideas without any boundaries. It is an awesome game that you could play with your team if you need as much as ideas possible to solve a problem.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was in TWU I was assigned to implement a simple program in Java Command line. I was ok but when I came to TDD approach I really didn&#8217;t know what to do and test command-line in JUnit. I googled but I found nothing. However, after <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/">Mark Needham</a> shows us in code and it was rather easy to do that. So I think I would write the example so that I could remember.</p>

<p>If you have a program like this. How would you test it in JUnit?</p>

<p>What he pointed out to test this kind of program is to implement a queue in InputStreamReader.</p>

<p>This is the example</p>
