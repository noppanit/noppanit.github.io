  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have found this definition of programmer which is really funny and true.</p>

<blockquote><p>Programmer n. (proh-gram-er) an organism that turns caffeine and pizza into software</p></blockquote>

<p>. You can order this lousy T-Shirt <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/programmer_definition_t_shirt-235878094715752076">here</a>.</p>

<p>I know everybody loves a cup of Joe. I&#8217;m amazed when people order decaf coffee which I have to resist myself to ask this question every time, &#8220;Why on earth you want to drink that?&#8221;, I&#8217;m sure most people who are coffee fanatic will ask the same question. Well, that&#8217;s the purpose of this blog here. I love coffee and I love it dark, rich and no milk. Now my love for coffee grows and I cannoy quench my thirst for a perfect cup with my french press anymore, so I seek help from professionals.</p>

<p>So far, I have been drinking my coffee from <a href="http://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/" title="monmouth coffee">Monmouth</a> in London, which I&#8217;m sure people love them and lucky me my office is just 5 min walk to the coffee shop. But what about at home? How do I drink the same quality coffee at home. Like most people, when I was a student I could not afford a Â£2 cup of coffee. My coffee intake had always come from instant coffee. Now I have (not so much) money I can enjoy what I love drinking the most. I started with filter coffee which you can buy filters from supermarket. They&#8217;re cheap and you can make a decent coffee if done it right. However, I don&#8217;t want to buy new filters every week considering how much I drink coffee everyday. Until my girlfriend gave me this as my birthday present with ground coffee from Starbucks (I know, I know but hey that was my first ground coffee). My life has changed you just pour ground coffee and in with hot water wait for a couple minutes and plunge and enjoy!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my setting so far.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/French-Press-5.jpg"><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/French-Press-5.jpg" alt="French Press" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1142 cool_border" /></a></p>

<p>My quest has not stopped there. I decided to take a further step by taking up a Barista course at <a href="http://www.taylor-st.com/home-barista-course" title="TAylor">taylor</a>. I have learned more about coffee origins, cupping, how to stream milk and good ratio for espresso.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s my take from the course which I think it was really comprehensive.</p>

<ul>
<li>Never buy ground coffee, once the coffee has been grinned it&#8217;s losing its aroma and quality.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t stock up your coffee, buy small batch and don&#8217;t keep it longer than 6 months.</li>
<li>Good ratio for espresso and water is 1:1.2, but you need to find your golden ratio. And it&#8217;s different for every coffee. So, if you try new coffee you need to adjust your balance.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t freeze your coffee, think of it as your spice.</li>
<li>Grind size, does and time matter a lot to your coffee</li>
</ul>


<p>After I have learned all of this I changed my way of making coffee. I still cannot afford a decent espresso machine but I know how to tune up my way of making coffee. I used to just put some 2-3 table spoons of coffee and boiling water and then plunge it right away. Sometime I over-extracted the coffee by letting the coffee submerged too long. Here&#8217;s some of the steps I have changed.</p>

<p>I still haven&#8217;t got a decent grinder so I&#8217;m still relying on my ground coffee from supermarket. I&#8217;ll buy a grinder soon which I&#8217;ll blog about that later.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of putting 2-3 table spoons of coffee, I weight it around 16-20 grams.</li>
<li>Instead of using boiling water, I put the kettle on, let it boil and after the switch is cut I leave it there for ~2 minutes so the temp drops to around 90. I remember went I bought a cup of coffee from big chained coffee shop and I had to let the coffee sit there for 10 minutes before I could even sip it.</li>
<li>Instead of guessing the amount of water, I use around 240mm for a cup of coffee. (This is not for espresso though).</li>
<li>Stir the coffee twice to make sure that all the coffee is submerged.</li>
<li>Instead of extract the coffee for sometime, I time it for 3:30 minutes and the last 30 seconds I just plunge and pour the coffee right away.</li>
</ul>


<p>I was really surprised how much my cup of Joe has changed even though I didn&#8217;t change the coffee or even my french press.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;m not going to stop just there, my quest continues. Now, I&#8217;m looking for a decent Espresso machine for my home brew&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK! I get bored and don&#8217;t have anything to do. I was sitting in front of my computer and search what can I do near London. And I found this <a href="http://www.walkingclub.org.uk/book_1/walk_31/index.shtml" title="Country Walk"></a>shtml</li></p>

<p>. I have to admit apart from boring and sucky weather in the UK, there&#8217;s one thing I really love, UK Countryside. The view, scenery, fellow walkers and farm animals. So, I picked this walk and I just went for it the next day.</p>

<p>the book really gives a precise instructions to follow. If you follow every detail in the book, you won&#8217;t get lost. Also, the book gives you local pubs and restaurants to visit.</p>

<p>This is where I started.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pinkcarnation/9489652764/" title="Walk 31- Glynde to Seaford-3.jpg by noppanit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2842/9489652764_64f2a857ce.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Walk 31- Glynde to Seaford-3.jpg" class="cool_border" /></a></p>

<p>Local market. It&#8217;s really a family run and you will get a warm smile when you walk in the store.<br/>

<p>Lonely barley.<br/>

<p>This for me is the toughest part of the walk, it&#8217;s right before you climb up Seven Sisters. It&#8217;s quite steep and long.<br/>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pinkcarnation/9489699086/" title="Walk 31- Glynde to Seaford-9.jpg by noppanit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3674/9489699086_5c28bedcab.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Walk 31- Glynde to Seaford-9.jpg" class="cool_border" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to try this someday.<br/>
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pinkcarnation/9486907035/" title="Walk 31- Glynde to Seaford-13.jpg by noppanit, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2835/9486907035_83bd67cab8.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Walk 31- Glynde to Seaford-13.jpg" class="cool_border" /></a></p>

<p>A soup at George Inn.<br/>

<p>This fellow is really funny. She was chasing me all the way to the end of the field. I don&#8217;t know why, but I think it&#8217;s because I had food in my rucksack. Later, when I met my fellow walkers they told me they had the same problem as well.<br/>

<p>Really good view.<br/>

<p>Seven Sisters on the other side. The view was taken from Seaford side, where most people are on the other Eastbourne side.<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the last couple of weeks I have been researching how to secure my personal data, I think it&#8217;s mainly because the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)" title="PRISM">PRISM</a> or <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/" title="PRISM slides">NSA scandal</a>. However, I&#8217;m pretty sure if the government wants to access your data they can do one way or another. So, you absolutely cannot avoid that.</p>

<p>So, I decided to secure my data the other way, Password. Ola Bini has <a href="https://olabini.com/blog/2012/08/passwords-are-terrible/" title="Why password are terrible">blogged</a> about why we shouldn&#8217;t use the same password for every website. And if you&#8217;re like me and other people you probably use the same password for more than one website. If you forget about it then that&#8217;s why the reset password functionality is for. My <a href="http://suksant.com/" title="Suksant">friend</a> has mentioned this approach where he use a complicated password and tried to remember it, if he forgot about it then he would just reset it.</p>

<p>And you will see news everyday about how every major website has been hacked <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/08/twitter-hacked-password-reset-request-_n_2093596.html" title="Twitter password hacked">here</a> and <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/12/tech/web/yahoo-users-hacked/" title="yahoo password hacked">here</a>, just examples and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s much more. Some people might say, if your password has been exposed no matter how string it is it&#8217;s just a matter of typing. It&#8217;s true but if you&#8217;re password is hacked in an encoded form then it might take longer to crack it. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s not possible to crack it, because according to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law" title="Moore's law">Moore&#8217;s law</a> anything is possible. So, the only thing you can do is to slow the bad guy down.</p>

<p>So, what action do I take?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Email, I depend my life on Google. Simply, I just turned on <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744?hl=en" title="2-way authentication">2-way authentication</a>. And I download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2" title="Google Authenticator">Google Authenticator</a> app on my phone. So, every time I need to access my email from else where I need to enter a random code from my phone on the website. This will give you something more secured. I also use this app for other websites such as DropBox as well. So, I just turn on 2-way authentication on every website that provide this mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p>Password manager, I rely my life on <a href="https://agilebits.com/" title="1password">1Password</a>. This is a nice application to generate strong password for you and remember it for you. Instead of remember all strong password from millions of websites, you just have to remember one strong password for the master password for 1password and it will take care of the rest for you. Of course, we have to trust our life with this company. But from what I have googled they&#8217;re pretty reliable. And my company provides the license to purchase the app. I have used the app on my Mac and my android phone. It&#8217;s pretty good so far. This is a nice <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/the-secret-to-online-safety-lies-random-characters-and-a-password-manager/">article</a> about 1Password so you can give it a go. They also have browser plugin so you can login to the website from the plugin.</p></li>
<li><p>Secure browser, this is nothing to do with security, because no matter what you do you still need a browser to check everything, email, news and other stuff. I use <a href="http://www.torproject.us/projects/torbrowser.html.en" title="Tor">Tor</a> bundle browser to browse a little more securely. Tor will create a secure channel for you to browser anonymously. Of course, there&#8217;s no real way to do that, but something is better than nothing. Tor creates proxy channels so bad guy cannot track you who you are and where you&#8217;re from. It&#8217;s slow, but if you want to keep your online browsing anonymous. Tor is a good start. Nobody likes to be tracked everything you do online, at least I don&#8217;t like it.</p></li>
<li><p>Forget Google, this might sound crazy but as we know the main revenue of Google is advertisement. They will do what ever they can to give you relevant ads so you can click on them. The more you click the richer they are. So, I change my searching experience to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" title="DuckDuckGo">duckduckgo</a>. They claim that they don&#8217;t store anything. So, you can be fairly sure that what ever you do on their website they don&#8217;t store your behaviour. Such as, what you click first or your search terms. Of course, I still use Google because admittedly they&#8217;re the best out there right now.</p></li>
<li><p>Logout, this is really simple but most people don&#8217;t do it because it&#8217;s not convenient. No matter how strong your password is if you don&#8217;t logout I just have to open your browser and access your email or Facebook. I don&#8217;t even have to crack it.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want everything to be secure, then it might be easier to just don&#8217;t store it on the cloud. You can start closing down your accounts from website you hardly use.</p></li>
<li><p>These days, you can use Gmail, Facebook or Twitter to signup for most websites. You may grant access to those websites with your Facebook account, but if you don&#8217;t use it anymore then you can revoke the access. Otherwise, they can use your details without knowing your password at all.</p></li>
<li><p>HTTPS, this is simple if you use Tor, because Tor will try to use HTTPS whenever possible. And yeh, something is better than nothing. HTTPS is a secure way to do everything online. If you have to give out your credit card number for online shopping, please look for a padlock or green bar on your browser to make sure that you use a secure channel. Just secure everything.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>These are just simple actions you can take to secure your life. Most people might say I have nothing to hide so why bother (I got this quote from Ola Bini). Yes, it might be true but if you have nothing to hide so why don&#8217;t you just lay around your credit card or your photos for everybody to see.</p>

<p>What else did I miss?</p>

<p>This has just happened to be last night when I was on a phone and I didn&#8217;t notice that my battery was about to run out. So, I kept talking and suddenly my phone went off. I quickly plugged my phone into the wall charger again and push the power button in hope that it would give me the HTC One logo once again. But my hope was in vain, nothing showed up it was just a blank black screen. This has to me before when I was using Blackberry Bold 9700. What I did was that I pulled the battery out and put it back in again, and it worked. Now, HTC One doesn&#8217;t have back cover so you cannot pull the battery out. I searched all over the Internet but no luck as the phone is quite new and I guess no one has been this dumb like me. Here&#8217;s what I did to get my phone back on again.</p>

<ol>
<li>Charge your phone to the wall charger again for at least 1 hour just to give your battery a kick.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Volume Down</strong> button and press the <strong>Power</strong> button together for as long as you can. Some says for 10 seconds but for me it was longer than that.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re lucky you phone will turn on and give you some options. You can choose <strong>Fast boot</strong> by using <strong>Volume Up/Down</strong> button to choose between options and use the <strong>Power</strong> button to select.</li>
<li>And yeh! Your phone will reboot. Never ever let your battery die again.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you work on web development you probably have heard <a href="http://angularjs.org/" title="angularjs">AngularJs</a> at some point. It&#8217;s a framework created by people at Google. So, we can be sure in some level for people who working behind this project. To summarise this project in short, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a framework to help you build a web application in an MVC-style same as <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" title="backbone.js">Backbone.js</a> but easier I&#8217;d say. AngularJs extends HTML instead of fighting with the language, so you can easily write your own HTML to manipulate your page. I&#8217;d recommend have a look at the <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial" title="angularjs tutorial">documentation</a> to understand more of AngularJs.</p>

<p>I guess this is a really buzz word for 2013. Single-page apps utilises AJAX to build a single page web application. So, user gets the same feeling as using native mobile application. I&#8217;d say this is the strongest point in AngularJs, if you&#8217;re thinking of building a simple single-page app AngularJs is worth to have a look for. However, you can also build a single-page application easily yourself but if you&#8217;re lazy like me, have a look at <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-seed" title="angular-seed">angular-seed</a> to get you started quickly.</p>

<h2>Off-line application</h2>

<p>One thing that I really like about AngularJs is, it somehow enforces you to use client-side templating. So, you can make a request to your server and return data in JSON format which you can use AngularJs to manipulate that data to build a webpage. Also, you can cache those data in LocalStorage or use Browser caching so if users&#8217; phone doesn&#8217;t have signal they can still use your application. Of course you can do the same with client-side templating like <a href="http://mustache.github.io/" title="mustache">mustache</a>.</p>

<h2>Learning Curve</h2>

<p>I&#8217;d said this is the biggest flaw of AngularJs because the documentation is not quite extensive. However, you can get by by asking people at stackoverflow or google forum. They&#8217;re plenty of people who can support you. Also, if you&#8217;re new to AngularJs it might take sometime to learn how to use AngularJs correctly. AngularJs would allow you to do anything as long as you&#8217;re not doing anything severely bad. AngularJs also won&#8217;t complain anything if you&#8217;re not following the desired design pattern. I&#8217;d strongly suggest you have a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhfUv0spHCY" title="AngularJs Best Practices">video</a> to learn how to do things in AngularJs from the creators of AngularJs. It took me a while and a lot of trial-and-errors. For example, you can use <strong>$http</strong> instead of <strong>resource</strong>.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>If you search this &#8216;performance angularjs&#8217; you&#8217;d find a lot of articles complaining about performance of AngularJs, which I also have encountered myself on my project. AngularJs uses technique called dirty-checking, which will check for changes of each object in your model. If you have a lot of objects in your model it&#8217;d substantially hurt your performance of the application. You have to keep an eye on the performance of your application and I&#8217;d suggest you use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/angularjs-batarang/ighdmehidhipcmcojjgiloacoafjmpfk?hl=en">AngularJs-Batarang</a> to find the hot spot. But most cases, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re loading too many objects or please consider using pagination (I know I hate that too!). Lazy loading is also the technique I use to overcome this issue. Generally speaking, if you&#8217;re not doing something crazy I&#8217;d say angularjs is pretty fast and slick.</p>

<h2>jQuery</h2>

<p>One thing that I&#8217;d avoid as much as possible to do on mobile application is jQuery. It&#8217;s a huge framework for mobile phone. AngularJs comes with jQuery-lite which you can use popular methods like in jQuery without loading the whole jQuery framework in your application. So, if you think you have to use jQuery in your Angualarjs application please think twice. If you need to manipulate DOM you can try plain-old javascript to do that first, if it&#8217;s getting bloated then you can try jQuery but you have to keep an eye on the performance as well.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In general, AngularJs is a good framework if you want to do single-page application or normal web-application in MVC style. I tried Backbone.js and I felt it&#8217;s really hard to grasp the concept. I find AngularJs more natural and intuitive. Performance is a big thing in AngularJs so you have to keep an eye on that if you have a lot of objects on your webpage it&#8217;ll hurt the load time because of dirty-checking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just rolled off from a project using AngularJS and Play 2.1.1. It was a mobile website, I wish I could include the site here as well but it&#8217;s still in development. We are using Play! 2.1.1 Java and AngularJs to build a mobile website. So, I&#8217;d like to summarise my thoughts here.</p>

<h1>Play Framework 2.1.1</h1>

<p>It&#8217;s a really good framework if you want to start something quickly. It&#8217;s like Rail in Java. You have everything in this framework, ORM, LESS, RequireJS and also some caching strategy. If in the future, I have a requirement to create a prototype in Java I would choose this framework for sure (Who would create a prototype in Java anyways), buy hey! it can be that who knows. By the way, there are some downsides. As Play considers everything in static. That makes testing quite tricky. For example, every controller is statically created, if you want to have something injected to your controller you have to create a custom global configuration for Play!. Here&#8217;s the example.</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container text blackboard" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:100%;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />2<br />3<br />4<br />5<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="text codecolorer">
          # Global object class<br /> # ~~~~~<br /> # Define the Global object class for this application.<br /> # Default to Global in the root package.<br /> application.global=global.CustomGlobal
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>




<div class="codecolorer-container java blackboard" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:100%;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />2<br />3<br />4<br />5<br />6<br />7<br />8<br />9<br />10<br />11<br />12<br />13<br />14<br />15<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="java codecolorer">
          <span class="kw1">package</span> <span class="co2">global</span><span class="sy0">;</span><br /> <br /> <span class="co1">// CAUTION: this class name must be specified in application.conf</span><br /> <span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="kw1">class</span> CustomGlobal <span class="kw1">extends</span> GlobalSettings <span class="br0">&#123;</span><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="kw1">private</span> <span class="kw1">static</span> MutablePicoContainer dependencies <span class="sy0">=</span> wireUpDependencies<span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span><br /> <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="kw1">private</span> <span class="kw1">static</span> MutablePicoContainer wireUpDependencies<span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span> <span class="br0">&#123;</span><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MutablePicoContainer container <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="kw1">new</span> DefaultPicoContainer<span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="co1">// Do some injections.</span><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<span class="br0">&#125;</span><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;@Override<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kw1">public</span> <span class="sy0"><</span>A<span class="sy0">></span> A getControllerInstance<span class="br0">&#40;</span>Class<span class="sy0"><</span>A<span class="sy0">></span> aControllerClass<span class="br0">&#41;</span> <span class="kw1">throws</span> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=allinurl%3Aexception+java.sun.com&btnI=I%27m%20Feeling%20Lucky"><span class="kw3">Exception</span></a> <span class="br0">&#123;</span><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="kw1">return</span> dependencies.<span class="me1">getComponent</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span>aControllerClass<span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="br0">&#125;</span><br /> <span class="br0">&#125;</span>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<p>Then in <strong>/routes</strong> you can use <strong>@</strong> to say not create a controller statically.</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container java blackboard" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:100%;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="java codecolorer">
          GET &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="sy0">/</span> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; @controllers.<span class="me1">coop</span>.<span class="me1">main</span>.<span class="me1">Application</span>.<span class="me1">index</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span>any <span class="sy0">=</span> <span class="st0">"none"</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<p>Other thing is EBean which comes with Play!. EBean is built on top of JPA. However, this means you have to learn a new framework if you know Hibernate already. They are quite close. Other than that, I think Play! is great. If you have time you might want to have a look at <a href="http://dropwizard.codahale.com/" title="DropWizard">DropWizard</a> if you just want to create a RESTFul service or <a href="http://www.sparkjava.com/download.html" title="SPARK">SPARK</a> for a sinatra-like java framework.</p>

<h2>EBean Query tuning</h2>

<p>EBean is like another version of Hibernate. It&#8217;s basically an ORM framework. There&#8217;s a catch in EBean if you turn the showing query on and if you join two or three tables and you use RawSql EBean will fire a lot of query to fetch each and every row you want to use. You will see a massive log. That hurts the performance. If you could use basic EBean for example.</p>

<div class="codecolorer-container java blackboard" style="overflow:auto;white-space:nowrap;width:100%;">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr>
      <td class="line-numbers">
        <div>
          1<br />2<br />3<br />4<br />
        </div>
      </td>
      
      <td>
        <div class="java codecolorer">
          List<span class="sy0"><</span>Order<span class="sy0">></span> orders <span class="sy0">=</span> &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; Ebean.<span class="me1">find</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span>Order.<span class="kw1">class</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<span class="me1">fetch</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="st0">"customer"</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .<span class="me1">findList</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span><span class="sy0">;</span>
        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<p>If you use .fetch(&#8220;customer&#8221;) it will just fire one query. So be careful. If you see a performance hit in your app and if it&#8217;s because of database. Check this <a href="http://www.avaje.org/ebean/introquery_joinquery.html" title="EBean join query.">link</a>. So, keep an eye on your performance because the peak might be on your query.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Play! is a good framework for doing something really quick and you don&#8217;t want to get your hands dirty with Spring or pure Java servlet. My biggest catch for Play! for me is the ability to write tests and to inject something to a controller. That means it&#8217;s hard to write unit-test but you can still write integration tests. If you&#8217;re ok with this fact I guess Play! is a good framework to look out for.</p>

<p>Also, Play! documentation is quite incomplete. And every version is really different than the prior version. So, please be careful to choose the write version of your documentation otherwise you might be scratching your head for a long time until you figure it out you&#8217;re looking at the wrong documentation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been working with AngularJs and I loved it, but occasionally I ran into some problems and the documentation is not that reliable. So, I&#8217;m helping them to increase the rank.</p>

<p>Recently, I have this problem when Play saved some session in cookie already, but I can&#8217;t use $cookies from AngularJs to read the cookie. So, I started digging in and I found that those cookies are set with <strong>httpOnly</strong> by default. If you have that flag on any plugins (e.g, AngularJs) cannot read that cookie. So, it Play 1 you can set <strong>application.session.httpOnly=false</strong> but in Play 2.1 they changed to <strong>session.httpOnly=false</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping I can save some people&#8217;s time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I guess the title of this blog is kinda wired and I don&#8217;t know how to make it better. People might be wondering why would you want to do that. So, on the current project we have a little requirement to seed the data for the designers to mock the data into the database but they don&#8217;t want to open IDE and run a program. And we would like to use EBean Entities because that should be the models of the application. Let&#8217;s look at the code.</p>

<p>People might be wondering it should be difficult because Play comes with EBean already but when you run this class from the main class you are outside of Play world and it becomes a little problem. First, EBean will complain about</p>

<p>Because Product has been marked @Entity already but we also extends that with Model for other magic methods again. Here&#8217;s the trick which I use -javaagent:/${PROJECT_HOME}/lib/ebean-2.7.7-agent.jar</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you every heard of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-22267613" title="Suspended coffee">Suspended Coffee?</a> Or you have you ever heard of <a href="https://www.livebelowtheline.com/uk" title="live below the line.">Live Below The Line</a>? Last week, a bunch of friends at work embarked on a very challenging quest to live for just Â£1 a day for 5 consecutive days. At first, I thought it was going to be easy because at school I used to live off just noodles and some snacks. Like most colleague students, they don&#8217;t eat much but play more. I spent 8 hours a day sitting on a computer playing games without eating anything or just one meal a day. So, I decided to participated the quest.</p>

<p>On Sunday, because I was working in Manchester and I had to travel from London so I didn&#8217;t have much time to shop at all. When I got in Manchester most shops were closed only a few supermarket open, so I went straight in there just to find some breakfast for the next day. And I only found these.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image.jpg" alt="Bread and baked beans" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1078 cool_border" /></p>

<p>I only got a bag of slices and two tins of baked beans. I spent Â£1.85.</p>

<p>On Monday, I ate two spoonful of baked beans and two slices of bread and I felt really full. I had to drink plenty of water in order to keep my stomach happy. At lunch I ate some baked beans which I wasn&#8217;t satisfied at all, after the break my stomach kept calling me that this wasn&#8217;t enough at all. Because yesterday I didn&#8217;t have time to do some shopping so I went to China Town just to get some more supply and I got these. 4 packs of instant noodles and a bag of celery.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image-2.jpg" alt="instant noodles" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1079 cool_border" /></p>

<p>On Tuesday, the breakfast and lunch still the same baked beans and bread. Today, I wasn&#8217;t hungry as yesterday I think because my body adjusted to the situation already but I couldn&#8217;t wait for dinner, because I was going to have my first hot meal, Mama.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image-4.jpg" alt="baked beans and bread" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1080 cool_border" /></p>

<p>On Wednesday, the breakfast still the same but I decided to not have baked beans but packed my instant noodles for lunch instead and dinner I had just celery sticks and carrots. Today, I decided to spent a little bit more because I was fed up with baked beans already. So, I got more supply, bananas and a bag of carrots which my seemed to be really popular among my live below the liners.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image-5.jpg" alt="bananas and carrots" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1081 cool_border" /></p>

<p>This evening I decided to take a little blissful walk in the City centre and my feeling was kinda mixed when seeing people eating their ice-cream or drinking coffee. I wish I could do that and I knew that most hungry people who felt the same as I did.</p>

<p>On Thursday, I packed my celery sticks and carrots and banana for my lunch it was like luxury for me. But today I wasn&#8217;t hungry at all I guess my body just knew what I was trying to do there.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image-3.jpg" alt="carrots and banana and celery stick" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1082 cool_border" /></p>

<p>Last day, I ended up with just one carrot left on the train back to London and I gave one of my bananas to my friend who forgot to bring his lunch.</p>

<p>So I spent Â£4.98 in total for 5 days. and I raised Â£40 from my friends, thank you very much Suksant and Seema. I really appreciate this.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/image-1.jpg" alt="receipts " class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084 cool_border" /></p>

<p>At the end, I knew this wasn&#8217;t even close to what millions of people have to live with and they have to spend Â£1 for anything else as well apart from food. But I realised not just that I could totally live on Â£1 a day, but also raised my awareness that they are lots of tough sleepers out there who don&#8217;t have the luxury as we all have.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think everybody knows Twitter, if you haven&#8217;t used it. I&#8217;m pretty sure that you might have heard of it at some point. So, briefly it&#8217;s a service where you can post anything in 140 characters. Most people tweet about news and what&#8217;s going on in their life. But some people is monitoring some hashtag or keywords and spam you back as well.</p>

<p>However, recently I&#8217;ve been tweeting and complaining or even asking questions a lot on Twitter and am surprise the response I got back every time. I know this is not something new.</p>

<p>For example, I didn&#8217;t know where to find a dentist, so I tweeted &#8220;Where can I find a dentist around Holborn?&#8221; And this is the response I got.</p>

<blockquote><p>@noppanit We have studios Covent Garden, Soho, Bank Moorgate and Canary Wharf if any of these suit? <img src="http://www.noppanit.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p></blockquote>

<p>And I went there and I was happy to go there. So, if you&#8217;re a small business and don&#8217;t know where to start marketing, twitter marketing by monitoring keywords and hashtags might work for you.</p>
