          <p>I think everybody knows Twitter, if you haven’t used it. I’m pretty sure that you might have heard of it at some point. So, briefly it’s a service where you can post anything in 140 characters. Most people tweet about news and what’s going on in their life. But some people is monitoring some hashtag or keywords and spam you back as well.</p>

<p>However, recently I’ve been tweeting and complaining or even asking questions a lot on Twitter and am surprise the response I got back every time. I know this is not something new.</p>

<p>For example, I didn’t know where to find a dentist, so I tweeted “Where can I find a dentist around Holborn?” And this is the response I got.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@noppanit We have studios Covent Garden, Soho, Bank Moorgate and Canary Wharf if any of these suit?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I went there and I was happy to go there. So, if you’re a small business and don’t know where to start marketing, twitter marketing by monitoring keywords and hashtags might work for you.</p>
